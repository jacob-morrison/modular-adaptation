But Westinghouse was soon forced by his backers to renegotiate their contract, with Tesla relinquishing his royalty rights.\nIn the 1890s Tesla invented electric oscillators, meters, improved lights and the high-voltage transformer known as the Tesla coil.

{"prompt": "When was Jean Racing baptized? Where did she die?\n\nJean Racine, in full Jean-Baptiste Racine, (baptized December 22, 1639, La Fert\u00e9-Milon, France\u2014died April 21, 1699, Paris), French dramatic poet and historiographer renowned for his mastery of French classical tragedy. His reputation rests on the plays he wrote between 1664 and 1691, notably Andromaque (first performed 1667, published 1668), Britannicus (first performed 1669, published 1670), B\u00e9r\u00e9nice (first performed 1670, published 1671), Bajazet (first performed and published 1672), Ph\u00e8dre (first performed and published 1677), and Athalie (first performed and published 1691).\n\nRacine was born into a provincial family of minor administrators who were financially comfortable and socially ambitious. His mother died 13 months after he was born, and his father died two years later. His maternal grandparents took him in, and, when his grandmother, Marie des Moulins, became a widow, she brought Racine with her, perhaps as early as 1646, to live at the convent of Port-Royal des Champs near Paris. Since a group of devout scholars and teachers had founded a school there, Racine had the opportunity to study the classics of Latin and Greek literature with distinguished masters. The school was steeped in the austere Roman Catholic reform movement that came to be known as Jansenism, which had recently been condemned by the church as heretical. The Jansenists participated in the centuries-long debate over the primacy of free will or of divine omnipotence in the process of salvation. Inspired by the writings of Saint Augustine, as transmitted by Cornelius Otto Jansen, bishop of Ypres, in his work Augustinus (1640), the Jansenists believed that salvation was a gift\u2014a grace\u2014that was accorded only by God and that free will played little role in the process. For these Augustinians, life on earth was to be a rigorous pursuit of penance for original sin. Since the French monarchy suspected the Jansenists of being not only theologically but also politically subversive, Racine\u2019s lifelong relationship with his former friends and teachers remained ambivalent, inasmuch as the artist ever sought admittance into the secular realm of court society. His former teachers remained extremely disappointed in a man who had used his excellent education as a means of succeeding in a profession that Port-Royal considered an abomination, because the theatre promoted illusion as a distraction from reflection on the wretched human condition.

Where did she die?\n\nJean Racine, in full Jean-Baptiste Racine, (baptized December 22, 1639, La Fert\u00e9-Milon, France\u2014died April 21, 1699, Paris), French dramatic poet and historiographer renowned for his mastery of French classical tragedy. His reputation rests on the plays he wrote between 1664 and 1691, notably Andromaque (first performed 1667, published 1668), Britannicus (first performed 1669, published 1670), B\u00e9r\u00e9nice (first performed 1670, published 1671), Bajazet (first performed and published 1672), Ph\u00e8dre (first performed and published 1677), and Athalie (first performed and published 1691).\n\nRacine was born into a provincial family of minor administrators who were financially comfortable and socially ambitious. His mother died 13 months after he was born, and his father died two years later. His maternal grandparents took him in, and, when his grandmother, Marie des Moulins, became a widow, she brought Racine with her, perhaps as early as 1646, to live at the convent of Port-Royal des Champs near Paris. Since a group of devout scholars and teachers had founded a school there, Racine had the opportunity to study the classics of Latin and Greek literature with distinguished masters. The school was steeped in the austere Roman Catholic reform movement that came to be known as Jansenism, which had recently been condemned by the church as heretical. The Jansenists participated in the centuries-long debate over the primacy of free will or of divine omnipotence in the process of salvation. Inspired by the writings of Saint Augustine, as transmitted by Cornelius Otto Jansen, bishop of Ypres, in his work Augustinus (1640), the Jansenists believed that salvation was a gift\u2014a grace\u2014that was accorded only by God and that free will played little role in the process. For these Augustinians, life on earth was to be a rigorous pursuit of penance for original sin. Since the French monarchy suspected the Jansenists of being not only theologically but also politically subversive, Racine\u2019s lifelong relationship with his former friends and teachers remained ambivalent, inasmuch as the artist ever sought admittance into the secular realm of court society. His former teachers remained extremely disappointed in a man who had used his excellent education as a means of succeeding in a profession that Port-Royal considered an abomination, because the theatre promoted illusion as a distraction from reflection on the wretched human condition. The degree to which his upbringing at Port-Royal inspired Racine\u2019s tragic vision is a question unlikely to be answered with any precision, given the other influences exerted on him, such as those of Greek and Roman tragedy, the Bible, and life itself.\n\nAfter leaving Port-Royal in 1653, Racine transferred to the College of Beauvais for almost two years and then returned to Port-Royal in October 1655 to complete his studies in rhetoric.

{"prompt": "What was the Apalachee population before European contact?\n\n\nThere has been a human presence in Franklin County for thousands of years.\n\nFrom at least A.D. 1000, a group of farming Indians known as the Apalachee lived in northwest Florida. Their territory extended from the Aucilla River to the east and the Ochlockonee River to the west, and from what is now the Georgia state line to the Gulf of Mexico. Prior to European contact, there were at least 50,000-60,000 Apalachees. They were a strong and powerful tribe living in widely dispersed villages. Other tribes respected the Apalachees because they belonged to an advanced Indian civilization, they were prosperous, and they were fierce warriors.\n\nFor food, they grew corn, beans and squash. Men prepared the fields and women tended the crops. Men also hunted bear, deer and small game, while women gathered nuts and berries. Traditionally the men wore deerskin loincloths and women wore Spanish moss skirts. When preparing for battle, the men painted their bodies with red ochre and put feathers in their hair.\n\nThe Apalachees played a ball game that was a religious exercise as well as a sport. One village would challenge another to a match, and the two teams would have up to 100 players each. They used a hard clay ball about the size of a golf ball covered with buckskin. Players propelled the ball with their feet toward the goal post which was a pole topped with a stuffed eagle in a nest. They played the ball game in the spring and summer, and dedicated it to the gods of rain and thunder to ensure rain for their crops.\n\nOne feature of Apalachee society was their large ceremonial mounds. The largest prehistoric Apalachee settlement at Lake Jackson north of Tallahassee originally consisted of seven large earthen mounds. Some of the mounds had structures on top, and it is generally believed that the largest mound within a complex was the site of the chief\u2019s house.\n\nThe Apalachee of northwest Florida were among the first indigenous North Americans encountered by European explorers. In 1539, Hernando de Soto wintered in Apalachee Province. His expedition members stayed in the sixteenth century Apalachee capital village called Anhaica. They received a hostile reception and were under almost constant attack from the Apalachees. The European presence eventually took its toll on the Apalachees from continual skirmishes and, eventually, contagious diseases that were introduced by the explorers. When epidemics and the threat of foreign attacks brought about a loss of faith in the traditional customs and leadership, the Apalachees converted to Catholicism.

Their territory extended from the Aucilla River to the east and the Ochlockonee River to the west, and from what is now the Georgia state line to the Gulf of Mexico. Prior to European contact, there were at least 50,000-60,000 Apalachees. They were a strong and powerful tribe living in widely dispersed villages. Other tribes respected the Apalachees because they belonged to an advanced Indian civilization, they were prosperous, and they were fierce warriors.\n\nFor food, they grew corn, beans and squash. Men prepared the fields and women tended the crops. Men also hunted bear, deer and small game, while women gathered nuts and berries. Traditionally the men wore deerskin loincloths and women wore Spanish moss skirts. When preparing for battle, the men painted their bodies with red ochre and put feathers in their hair.\n\nThe Apalachees played a ball game that was a religious exercise as well as a sport. One village would challenge another to a match, and the two teams would have up to 100 players each. They used a hard clay ball about the size of a golf ball covered with buckskin. Players propelled the ball with their feet toward the goal post which was a pole topped with a stuffed eagle in a nest. They played the ball game in the spring and summer, and dedicated it to the gods of rain and thunder to ensure rain for their crops.\n\nOne feature of Apalachee society was their large ceremonial mounds. The largest prehistoric Apalachee settlement at Lake Jackson north of Tallahassee originally consisted of seven large earthen mounds. Some of the mounds had structures on top, and it is generally believed that the largest mound within a complex was the site of the chief\u2019s house.\n\nThe Apalachee of northwest Florida were among the first indigenous North Americans encountered by European explorers. In 1539, Hernando de Soto wintered in Apalachee Province. His expedition members stayed in the sixteenth century Apalachee capital village called Anhaica. They received a hostile reception and were under almost constant attack from the Apalachees. The European presence eventually took its toll on the Apalachees from continual skirmishes and, eventually, contagious diseases that were introduced by the explorers. When epidemics and the threat of foreign attacks brought about a loss of faith in the traditional customs and leadership, the Apalachees converted to Catholicism. Anhaica, became one of the first missions established in Apalachee Province by Spanish Franciscan priests around 1633. It eventually relocated to present day Tallahassee and renamed San Luis de Talimali. In 1704 the mission system collapsed under the weight of British attacks.

Unlike my everyday chocolate chip cookies that are soft and chewy and a little crunchy, and unlike my thin and crispy chocolate chip cookies that are lace thin and have a serious snap, these cookies are seriously soft and so tender! With just the slightest chew! That comes from the addition of sour cream!\n\nThey kind of remind me of an extremely elevated Entemann\u2019s cookie! But a million times tastier!\n\nSoft Batch Chocolate Chip Cookies are super soft, tender, and flavorful! This is the PERFECT chocolate chip cookie recipe for making ice cream sandwiches!\nThese soft batch chocolate chip cookies are a staple during the holiday season. Fresh from the oven, they\u2019re so goody and enticing! But they also happen to make the BEST ice cream sandwiches! Their soft texture doesn\u2019t get too hard when frozen, so you can sink your teeth in with ease! So they\u2019re really the perfect Christmas in July recipe!\n\nSoft Batch Chocolate Chip Cookies are super soft, tender, and flavorful! This is the PERFECT chocolate chip cookie recipe for making ice cream sandwiches!\nBrown Butter Cookie Dough\nEven though these are soft batch cookies, we\u2019re not skipping the brown butter! The brown butter adds a TON of flavor and is the secret ingredient to making these cookies taste like they came from a fancy bakery!\n\nUsing melted brown butter also means this recipe can be made without an electric mixer! You can simply combine all of the ingredients in a large bowl! First you\u2019ll want to beat the butter, sugars, eggs, and vanilla. And then you\u2019ll add in your dry ingredients, and fold everything together until just combined!\n\nSoft Batch Chocolate Chip Cookies are super soft, tender, and flavorful! This is the PERFECT chocolate chip cookie recipe for making ice cream sandwiches!\nChill the Dough\nThis recipe calls for 2 chill times! But wait! Before you run away, let me explain! Because it\u2019s really not bad!\n\nFirst, you\u2019ll refrigerate the whole bowl of cookie dough for 30 minutes. This allows the cookie dough to firm up enough to be easily scooped and shaped into round balls. At this point you\u2019ll scoop the cookie dough onto a parchment paper lined baking sheet (put as many as you can fit on the sheet and don\u2019t worry about them being close) and pop the baking sheet back into the fridge for 2 more hours.\n\nCan I chill longer than 2 hours?\nYes!!! You can chill in the shaped cookie dough balls in the fridge for up to 3 days! Or you can freeze the cookie dough balls for up to 2 months. But if you refrigerate for longer than 24 hours, you may need to add a minute or two onto the baking time!\n\nSoft Batch Chocolate Chip Cookies are super soft, tender, and flavorful! This is the PERFECT chocolate chip cookie recipe for making ice cream sandwiches!\nBake the Cookies\nAbout 30 minutes before you plan on baking, preheat your oven and get your pans ready!\n\nSince we want soft cookies, we\u2019ll preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Then you\u2019ll want to line two large baking sheets with parchment paper. Once your cookie dough has sufficiently chilled, remove it from the oven and transfer balls of the cookie dough to your prepared pans, leaving 2-inches in between each for spreading. Then bake one tray at a time for 12 minutes!\n\nPlace the cookie tray on a wire rack and cool for at least 20 minutes before digging in!", "prompt_id": "993282c9bcc5bd62e49d6f03f903f3e045bc0be4e7804ab4c2923176ef97ab59", "messages": [{"content": "What is the maximum amount of time I could store chilled cookie dough in the refrigerator?

The brown butter adds a TON of flavor and is the secret ingredient to making these cookies taste like they came from a fancy bakery!\n\nUsing melted brown butter also means this recipe can be made without an electric mixer! You can simply combine all of the ingredients in a large bowl! First you\u2019ll want to beat the butter, sugars, eggs, and vanilla. And then you\u2019ll add in your dry ingredients, and fold everything together until just combined!\n\nSoft Batch Chocolate Chip Cookies are super soft, tender, and flavorful! This is the PERFECT chocolate chip cookie recipe for making ice cream sandwiches!\nChill the Dough\nThis recipe calls for 2 chill times! But wait! Before you run away, let me explain! Because it\u2019s really not bad!\n\nFirst, you\u2019ll refrigerate the whole bowl of cookie dough for 30 minutes. This allows the cookie dough to firm up enough to be easily scooped and shaped into round balls. At this point you\u2019ll scoop the cookie dough onto a parchment paper lined baking sheet (put as many as you can fit on the sheet and don\u2019t worry about them being close) and pop the baking sheet back into the fridge for 2 more hours.\n\nCan I chill longer than 2 hours?\nYes!!! You can chill in the shaped cookie dough balls in the fridge for up to 3 days! Or you can freeze the cookie dough balls for up to 2 months. But if you refrigerate for longer than 24 hours, you may need to add a minute or two onto the baking time!\n\nSoft Batch Chocolate Chip Cookies are super soft, tender, and flavorful! This is the PERFECT chocolate chip cookie recipe for making ice cream sandwiches!\nBake the Cookies\nAbout 30 minutes before you plan on baking, preheat your oven and get your pans ready!\n\nSince we want soft cookies, we\u2019ll preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Then you\u2019ll want to line two large baking sheets with parchment paper. Once your cookie dough has sufficiently chilled, remove it from the oven and transfer balls of the cookie dough to your prepared pans, leaving 2-inches in between each for spreading. Then bake one tray at a time for 12 minutes!\n\nPlace the cookie tray on a wire rack and cool for at least 20 minutes before digging in!", "role": "user"}, {"content": "According to the instructions, you can store chilled cookie dough balls in the fridge for up to 3 days.", "role": "assistant"}], "category": "Closed QA"}

{"prompt": "According to this article, why do cities like Boston, New York, and San Fransisco have more transit options?\n\nPublic transit systems face daunting challenges across the U.S., from pandemic ridership losses to traffic congestion, fare evasion and pressure to keep rides affordable. In some cities, including Boston, Kansas City and Washington, many elected officials and advocates see fare-free public transit as the solution.\n\nFederal COVID-19 relief funds, which have subsidized transit operations across the nation at an unprecedented level since 2020, offered a natural experiment in free-fare transit. Advocates applauded these changes and are now pushing to make fare-free bus lines permanent.\n\nBut although these experiments aided low-income families and modestly boosted ridership, they also created new political and economic challenges for beleaguered transit agencies. With ridership still dramatically below pre-pandemic levels and temporary federal support expiring, transportation agencies face an economic and managerial \u201cdoom spiral.\u201d\n\nFree public transit that doesn\u2019t bankrupt agencies would require a revolution in transit funding. In most regions, U.S. voters \u2013 85% of whom commute by automobile \u2013 have resisted deep subsidies and expect fare collection to cover a portion of operating budgets. Studies also show that transit riders are likely to prefer better, low-cost service to free rides on the substandard options that exist in much of the U.S.\n\nWhy isn\u2019t transit free?\nAs I recount in my new book, \u201cThe Great American Transit Disaster,\u201d mass transit in the U.S. was an unsubsidized, privately operated service for decades prior to the 1960s and 1970s. In the 19th and early 20th centuries, prosperous city dwellers used public transit to escape from overcrowded urban neighborhoods to more spacious \u201cstreetcar suburbs.\u201d Commuting symbolized success for families with the income to pay the daily fare.\n\nThese systems were self-financing: Transit company investors made their money in suburban real estate when rail lines opened up. They charged low fares to entice riders looking to buy land and homes. The most famous example was the Pacific Electric \u201cred car\u201d transit system in Los Angeles that Henry Huntingdon built to transform his vast landholdings into profitable subdivisions.\n\nHowever, once streetcar suburbs were built out, these companies had no further incentive to provide excellent transit. Unhappy voters felt suckered into crummy commutes. In response, city officials retaliated against the powerful transit interests by taxing them heavily and charging them for street repairs.\n\nMeanwhile, the introduction of mass-produced personal cars created new competition for public transit. As autos gained popularity in the 1920s and 1930s, frustrated commuters swapped out riding for driving, and private transit companies like Pacific Electric began failing.\n\nGrudging public takeovers\nIn most cities, politicians refused to prop up the often-hated private transit companies that now were begging for tax concessions, fare increases or public buyouts. In 1959, for instance, politicians still forced Baltimore\u2019s fading private transit company, the BTC, to divert US$2.6 million in revenues annually to taxes. The companies retaliated by slashing maintenance, routes and service.\n\nLocal and state governments finally stepped in to save the ruins of the hardest-strapped companies in the 1960s and 1970s. Public buyouts took place only after decades of devastating losses, including most streetcar networks, in cities such as Baltimore (1970), Atlanta (1971) and Houston (1974).\n\nThese poorly subsidized public systems continued to lose riders. Transit\u2019s share of daily commuters fell from 8.5% in 1970 to 4.9% in 2018. And while low-income people disproportionately ride transit, a 2008 study showed that roughly 80% of the working poor commuted by vehicle instead, despite the high cost of car ownership.\n\nThere were exceptions. Notably, San Francisco and Boston began subsidizing transit in 1904 and 1918, respectively, by sharing tax revenues with newly created public operators. Even in the face of significant ridership losses from 1945 to 1970, these cities\u2019 transit systems kept fares low, maintained legacy rail and bus lines and modestly renovated their systems.\n\nConverging pressures\nToday, public transit is under enormous pressure nationwide. Inflation and driver shortages are driving up operating costs. Managers are spending more money on public safety in response to rising transit crime rates and unhoused people using buses and trains for shelter.\n\nMany systems are also contending with decrepit infrastructure. The American Society of Civil Engineers gives U.S. public transit systems a grade of D-minus and estimates their national backlog of unmet capital needs at $176 billion. Deferred repairs and upgrades reduce service quality, leading to events like a 30-day emergency shutdown of an entire subway line in Boston in 2022.\n\n\nDespite flashing warning signs, political support for public transit remains weak, especially among conservatives. So it\u2019s not clear that relying on government to make up for free fares is sustainable or a priority.\n\nFor example, in Washington, conflict is brewing within the city government over how to fund a free bus initiative. Kansas City, the largest U.S. system to adopt fare-free transit, faces a new challenge: finding funding to expand its small network, which just 3% of its residents use.\n\nA better model\nOther cities are using more targeted strategies to make public transit accessible to everyone. For example, \u201cFair fare\u201d programs in San Francisco, New York and Boston offer discounts based on income, while still collecting full fares from those who can afford to pay. Income-based discounts like these reduce the political liability of giving free rides to everyone, including affluent transit users.\n\n\nSome providers have initiated or are considering fare integration policies. In this approach, transfers between different types of transit and systems are free; riders pay one time. For example, in Chicago, rapid transit or bus riders can transfer at no charge to a suburban bus to finish their trips, and vice versa.\n\nFare integration is less costly than fare-free systems, and lower-income riders stand to benefit. Enabling riders to pay for all types of trips with a single smart card further streamlines their journeys.\n\nAs ridership grows under Fair Fares and fare integration, I expect that additional revenue will help build better service, attracting more riders. Increasing ridership while supporting agency budgets will help make the political case for deeper public investments in service and equipment. A virtuous circle could develop.\n\nHistory shows what works best to rebuild public transit networks, and free transit isn\u2019t high on the list. Cities like Boston, San Francisco and New York have more transit because voters and politicians have supplemented fare collection with a combination of property taxes, bridge tolls, sales taxes and more.

Advocates applauded these changes and are now pushing to make fare-free bus lines permanent.\n\nBut although these experiments aided low-income families and modestly boosted ridership, they also created new political and economic challenges for beleaguered transit agencies. With ridership still dramatically below pre-pandemic levels and temporary federal support expiring, transportation agencies face an economic and managerial \u201cdoom spiral.\u201d\n\nFree public transit that doesn\u2019t bankrupt agencies would require a revolution in transit funding. In most regions, U.S. voters \u2013 85% of whom commute by automobile \u2013 have resisted deep subsidies and expect fare collection to cover a portion of operating budgets. Studies also show that transit riders are likely to prefer better, low-cost service to free rides on the substandard options that exist in much of the U.S.\n\nWhy isn\u2019t transit free?\nAs I recount in my new book, \u201cThe Great American Transit Disaster,\u201d mass transit in the U.S. was an unsubsidized, privately operated service for decades prior to the 1960s and 1970s. In the 19th and early 20th centuries, prosperous city dwellers used public transit to escape from overcrowded urban neighborhoods to more spacious \u201cstreetcar suburbs.\u201d Commuting symbolized success for families with the income to pay the daily fare.\n\nThese systems were self-financing: Transit company investors made their money in suburban real estate when rail lines opened up. They charged low fares to entice riders looking to buy land and homes. The most famous example was the Pacific Electric \u201cred car\u201d transit system in Los Angeles that Henry Huntingdon built to transform his vast landholdings into profitable subdivisions.\n\nHowever, once streetcar suburbs were built out, these companies had no further incentive to provide excellent transit. Unhappy voters felt suckered into crummy commutes. In response, city officials retaliated against the powerful transit interests by taxing them heavily and charging them for street repairs.\n\nMeanwhile, the introduction of mass-produced personal cars created new competition for public transit. As autos gained popularity in the 1920s and 1930s, frustrated commuters swapped out riding for driving, and private transit companies like Pacific Electric began failing.\n\nGrudging public takeovers\nIn most cities, politicians refused to prop up the often-hated private transit companies that now were begging for tax concessions, fare increases or public buyouts. In 1959, for instance, politicians still forced Baltimore\u2019s fading private transit company, the BTC, to divert US$2.6 million in revenues annually to taxes. The companies retaliated by slashing maintenance, routes and service.\n\nLocal and state governments finally stepped in to save the ruins of the hardest-strapped companies in the 1960s and 1970s. Public buyouts took place only after decades of devastating losses, including most streetcar networks, in cities such as Baltimore (1970), Atlanta (1971) and Houston (1974).\n\nThese poorly subsidized public systems continued to lose riders. Transit\u2019s share of daily commuters fell from 8.5% in 1970 to 4.9% in 2018. And while low-income people disproportionately ride transit, a 2008 study showed that roughly 80% of the working poor commuted by vehicle instead, despite the high cost of car ownership.\n\nThere were exceptions. Notably, San Francisco and Boston began subsidizing transit in 1904 and 1918, respectively, by sharing tax revenues with newly created public operators. Even in the face of significant ridership losses from 1945 to 1970, these cities\u2019 transit systems kept fares low, maintained legacy rail and bus lines and modestly renovated their systems.\n\nConverging pressures\nToday, public transit is under enormous pressure nationwide. Inflation and driver shortages are driving up operating costs. Managers are spending more money on public safety in response to rising transit crime rates and unhoused people using buses and trains for shelter.\n\nMany systems are also contending with decrepit infrastructure. The American Society of Civil Engineers gives U.S. public transit systems a grade of D-minus and estimates their national backlog of unmet capital needs at $176 billion. Deferred repairs and upgrades reduce service quality, leading to events like a 30-day emergency shutdown of an entire subway line in Boston in 2022.\n\n\nDespite flashing warning signs, political support for public transit remains weak, especially among conservatives. So it\u2019s not clear that relying on government to make up for free fares is sustainable or a priority.\n\nFor example, in Washington, conflict is brewing within the city government over how to fund a free bus initiative. Kansas City, the largest U.S. system to adopt fare-free transit, faces a new challenge: finding funding to expand its small network, which just 3% of its residents use.\n\nA better model\nOther cities are using more targeted strategies to make public transit accessible to everyone. For example, \u201cFair fare\u201d programs in San Francisco, New York and Boston offer discounts based on income, while still collecting full fares from those who can afford to pay. Income-based discounts like these reduce the political liability of giving free rides to everyone, including affluent transit users.\n\n\nSome providers have initiated or are considering fare integration policies. In this approach, transfers between different types of transit and systems are free; riders pay one time. For example, in Chicago, rapid transit or bus riders can transfer at no charge to a suburban bus to finish their trips, and vice versa.\n\nFare integration is less costly than fare-free systems, and lower-income riders stand to benefit. Enabling riders to pay for all types of trips with a single smart card further streamlines their journeys.\n\nAs ridership grows under Fair Fares and fare integration, I expect that additional revenue will help build better service, attracting more riders. Increasing ridership while supporting agency budgets will help make the political case for deeper public investments in service and equipment. A virtuous circle could develop.\n\nHistory shows what works best to rebuild public transit networks, and free transit isn\u2019t high on the list. Cities like Boston, San Francisco and New York have more transit because voters and politicians have supplemented fare collection with a combination of property taxes, bridge tolls, sales taxes and more.

{"prompt": "When did the public buyouts of privately-owned transit systems happen in Atlanta, Baltimore, and Houston? Use the article below to answer the question.\n\nPublic transit systems face daunting challenges across the U.S., from pandemic ridership losses to traffic congestion, fare evasion and pressure to keep rides affordable. In some cities, including Boston, Kansas City and Washington, many elected officials and advocates see fare-free public transit as the solution.\n\nFederal COVID-19 relief funds, which have subsidized transit operations across the nation at an unprecedented level since 2020, offered a natural experiment in free-fare transit. Advocates applauded these changes and are now pushing to make fare-free bus lines permanent.\n\nBut although these experiments aided low-income families and modestly boosted ridership, they also created new political and economic challenges for beleaguered transit agencies. With ridership still dramatically below pre-pandemic levels and temporary federal support expiring, transportation agencies face an economic and managerial \u201cdoom spiral.\u201d\n\nFree public transit that doesn\u2019t bankrupt agencies would require a revolution in transit funding. In most regions, U.S. voters \u2013 85% of whom commute by automobile \u2013 have resisted deep subsidies and expect fare collection to cover a portion of operating budgets. Studies also show that transit riders are likely to prefer better, low-cost service to free rides on the substandard options that exist in much of the U.S.\n\nWhy isn\u2019t transit free?\nAs I recount in my new book, \u201cThe Great American Transit Disaster,\u201d mass transit in the U.S. was an unsubsidized, privately operated service for decades prior to the 1960s and 1970s. In the 19th and early 20th centuries, prosperous city dwellers used public transit to escape from overcrowded urban neighborhoods to more spacious \u201cstreetcar suburbs.\u201d Commuting symbolized success for families with the income to pay the daily fare.\n\nThese systems were self-financing: Transit company investors made their money in suburban real estate when rail lines opened up. They charged low fares to entice riders looking to buy land and homes. The most famous example was the Pacific Electric \u201cred car\u201d transit system in Los Angeles that Henry Huntingdon built to transform his vast landholdings into profitable subdivisions.\n\nHowever, once streetcar suburbs were built out, these companies had no further incentive to provide excellent transit. Unhappy voters felt suckered into crummy commutes. In response, city officials retaliated against the powerful transit interests by taxing them heavily and charging them for street repairs.\n\nMeanwhile, the introduction of mass-produced personal cars created new competition for public transit. As autos gained popularity in the 1920s and 1930s, frustrated commuters swapped out riding for driving, and private transit companies like Pacific Electric began failing.\n\nGrudging public takeovers\nIn most cities, politicians refused to prop up the often-hated private transit companies that now were begging for tax concessions, fare increases or public buyouts. In 1959, for instance, politicians still forced Baltimore\u2019s fading private transit company, the BTC, to divert US$2.6 million in revenues annually to taxes. The companies retaliated by slashing maintenance, routes and service.\n\nLocal and state governments finally stepped in to save the ruins of the hardest-strapped companies in the 1960s and 1970s. Public buyouts took place only after decades of devastating losses, including most streetcar networks, in cities such as Baltimore (1970), Atlanta (1971) and Houston (1974).\n\nThese poorly subsidized public systems continued to lose riders. Transit\u2019s share of daily commuters fell from 8.5% in 1970 to 4.9% in 2018. And while low-income people disproportionately ride transit, a 2008 study showed that roughly 80% of the working poor commuted by vehicle instead, despite the high cost of car ownership.\n\nThere were exceptions. Notably, San Francisco and Boston began subsidizing transit in 1904 and 1918, respectively, by sharing tax revenues with newly created public operators. Even in the face of significant ridership losses from 1945 to 1970, these cities\u2019 transit systems kept fares low, maintained legacy rail and bus lines and modestly renovated their systems.\n\nConverging pressures\nToday, public transit is under enormous pressure nationwide. Inflation and driver shortages are driving up operating costs. Managers are spending more money on public safety in response to rising transit crime rates and unhoused people using buses and trains for shelter.\n\nMany systems are also contending with decrepit infrastructure. The American Society of Civil Engineers gives U.S. public transit systems a grade of D-minus and estimates their national backlog of unmet capital needs at $176 billion. Deferred repairs and upgrades reduce service quality, leading to events like a 30-day emergency shutdown of an entire subway line in Boston in 2022.\n\n\nDespite flashing warning signs, political support for public transit remains weak, especially among conservatives. So it\u2019s not clear that relying on government to make up for free fares is sustainable or a priority.\n\nFor example, in Washington, conflict is brewing within the city government over how to fund a free bus initiative. Kansas City, the largest U.S. system to adopt fare-free transit, faces a new challenge: finding funding to expand its small network, which just 3% of its residents use.\n\nA better model\nOther cities are using more targeted strategies to make public transit accessible to everyone. For example, \u201cFair fare\u201d programs in San Francisco, New York and Boston offer discounts based on income, while still collecting full fares from those who can afford to pay. Income-based discounts like these reduce the political liability of giving free rides to everyone, including affluent transit users.\n\n\nSome providers have initiated or are considering fare integration policies. In this approach, transfers between different types of transit and systems are free; riders pay one time. For example, in Chicago, rapid transit or bus riders can transfer at no charge to a suburban bus to finish their trips, and vice versa.\n\nFare integration is less costly than fare-free systems, and lower-income riders stand to benefit. Enabling riders to pay for all types of trips with a single smart card further streamlines their journeys.\n\nAs ridership grows under Fair Fares and fare integration, I expect that additional revenue will help build better service, attracting more riders. Increasing ridership while supporting agency budgets will help make the political case for deeper public investments in service and equipment. A virtuous circle could develop.\n\nHistory shows what works best to rebuild public transit networks, and free transit isn\u2019t high on the list. Cities like Boston, San Francisco and New York have more transit because voters and politicians have supplemented fare collection with a combination of property taxes, bridge tolls, sales taxes and more. Taking fares out of the formula spreads the red ink even faster.", "prompt_id": "84291de71125fc5b1b1f06e948343c644a1e31f45e6d6aa6e25d3f465a5f6c57", "messages": [{"content": "When did the public buyouts of privately-owned transit systems happen in Atlanta, Baltimore, and Houston?

Kansas City, the largest U.S. system to adopt fare-free transit, faces a new challenge: finding funding to expand its small network, which just 3% of its residents use.\n\nA better model\nOther cities are using more targeted strategies to make public transit accessible to everyone. For example, \u201cFair fare\u201d programs in San Francisco, New York and Boston offer discounts based on income, while still collecting full fares from those who can afford to pay. Income-based discounts like these reduce the political liability of giving free rides to everyone, including affluent transit users.\n\n\nSome providers have initiated or are considering fare integration policies. In this approach, transfers between different types of transit and systems are free; riders pay one time. For example, in Chicago, rapid transit or bus riders can transfer at no charge to a suburban bus to finish their trips, and vice versa.\n\nFare integration is less costly than fare-free systems, and lower-income riders stand to benefit. Enabling riders to pay for all types of trips with a single smart card further streamlines their journeys.\n\nAs ridership grows under Fair Fares and fare integration, I expect that additional revenue will help build better service, attracting more riders. Increasing ridership while supporting agency budgets will help make the political case for deeper public investments in service and equipment. A virtuous circle could develop.\n\nHistory shows what works best to rebuild public transit networks, and free transit isn\u2019t high on the list. Cities like Boston, San Francisco and New York have more transit because voters and politicians have supplemented fare collection with a combination of property taxes, bridge tolls, sales taxes and more. Taking fares out of the formula spreads the red ink even faster.", "role": "user"}, {"content": "Public buyouts of privately-owned transit systems happened in Atlanta in 1971, in Boston in 1970, and in Houston in 1974.", "role": "assistant"}], "category": "Closed QA"}

{"prompt": "From the text below, answer the following:\n\nHow many eggs do female cicadas lay at once?\nWhat parts of the U.S. do periodical cicadas live?\nHow do male cicadas make their shrill buzzing sounds?\n\nA Bug's Life\nCicadas start their lives as eggs. Females lay 200 to 400 eggs in tiny holes that they make in the branches of trees and shrubs. After six to 10 weeks, cicada young called nymphs hatch from the eggs and immediately fall to the ground. They burrow underground and attach to tree roots. The nymphs stay buried to suck tree sap from two to 17 years, depending on the species. When this underground life\u2014called the dormant period\u2014ends, the cicadas emerge aboveground at sunset, climb the trunk of a nearby tree, and shed their skin. Now they\u2019re adult cicadas.\n\nNext, male cicadas fill the air with shrill buzzing sounds created by rapidly vibrating drum-like plates on their abdomens. The females make clicking sounds with their wings if they like the song. They mate, lay their eggs, and then both male and female cicadas die after just about five weeks aboveground.\n\nTwo Types\nScientists divide the over 3,000 cicada species into two groups: annual and periodical. Annual cicadas emerge from the ground at different times each summer. They\u2019re usually dark with greenish markings. These insects avoid predators by camouflaging themselves in the trees and flying from hungry birds and moles.\n\nOnly seven species of cicadas are in the other group, called periodical cicadas. These bugs all emerge from the ground at the same time. Called broods, these groups appear after a dormant period of either 13 or 17 years. That\u2019s a long nap!\n\nPeriodical cicadas live only in the central and eastern part of the United States. They have black backs, orange bellies, and red eyes. Millions\u2014or even billions!\u2014of cicadas might come out all at once, so these bugs aren\u2019t trying to hide. They survive by having such a large population that predators couldn\u2019t possibly eat them all at once.\n\nBig Noise\nA different periodical brood emerges almost every year in different parts of the country. Some broods are small, like Brood VII (the Roman numeral for seven), which is found only in upstate New York.

Gonville married White Plume\u2019s daughter, Hunt Jimmy, and they had two daughters, Josette and Julie.

Josette and Julie received tracts three and four, Pelagie and Victoire received tracts five and six.\n\nJosette, also known as May Josephine, moved to the Kansas City, Missouri, area when she was young to live with the Chouteau family. There she served as an interpreter. Around 1839, Josette married Joseph Pappan.

The Pappan\u2019s ferry business prospered as more people headed west, until flooding destroyed the ferry and log cabin in June 1844.

{"prompt": "1. Up to what age can children travel for free?\n2. What ways can children stay safe on a plane?\n3. How do you purchase a ticket for an infant?\n\n\nChildren under 2 have the option of travelling sitting on your lap and not being assigned a seat. Lap infants often travel free on domestic flights in the USA and Canada, and at a 10% fare on international flights. In other countries a fare is applicable whether domestic or international. If you choose to have a seat for your baby some airlines have an infant rate, but this can be as much as 90% of the regular price. Even if you have to pay the full fare, some airport and government charges are usually not applied to children under 2.\n\nDuring take-off and landings infants on your lap should be held in an upright position facing you and against you, with your hands supporting their back and neck. Some infants are more comfortable nursing during these periods and most flight attendants will allow it. Saving a feed for the descent can make the baby much more comfortable. With some carriers a lap belt is available that loops into the adult belt and then around the lap infant for take-off and landings.\n\nConsider putting infants with their own seat in an approved car seat appropriate for their age and weight. This is compulsory in the USA, and recommended in other jurisdictions. Still, best to confirm with your airline that this, as different airline shave different rules on the type of car-seat that can fit onto their aircraft seat. Other airlines will not permit an unsupported infant in a seat without a car-seat.\n\nSome airlines do not have the facilities for infants to be booked through their website, and you must contact the call centre or a travel agent. You should make sure the airline knows about the infant at the time of booking the ticket. Turning up at the airport with an infant will cause difficulties at check-in.\n\nInfants younger than two weeks may require a certificate from a doctor saying they are able to fly.\n\nIf you have infants you can request a bassinet (usually only on long haul flights) which attaches to the bulkhead. Airline restrictions on weight and age vary from airline to airline. Check your airlines bassinet restrictions before you book. Needless to say, this can make long flight much more comfortable for the parent and child. For older infants, consider a bulkhead seat . Arm rests don't usually go up (the tray is in the armrest) unless on certain airlines, and you have to stow your carry-on bags in the overhead compartment during take-off and landing since there is no seat in front of you. On the plus side, bulkhead seats have more legroom, often enough for moving around without disturbing the occupant of the aisle seat, and there is no seat in front for the child to kick. Some airlines will let you book these when you purchase tickets, others give them out at a first-come-first-served basis at check-in only. Airlines won't let you place infants on the floor at your feet to sleep. Most airlines will ask you to remove your baby from the bassinet if it is turbulent. The current exceptions are Virgin Atlantic and Qantas.\n\nChildren between 2 and 12 must have their own ticket. Children this age are usually given a discounted rate (typically 66-75% of the adult fare) on full service international airlines, but usually have no discount on discount international or domestic airlines. Discounted children's tickets may have different baggage allowances so check before showing up. Child and baby meals are available on some flights offering meals. The usual rules for special meals apply, and they must be ordered in advance. Picky eaters may prefer a bag lunch.\n\nUnaccompanied children are usually children under 12 travelling without a supervising adult. Not all airlines accept unaccompanied children, especially discount airlines. An unaccompanied child may be required to travel on a full adult fare, and additional fees may be charged. Unaccompanied children will need to be collected at their destination by a named caregiver and may be returned to their point of departure if not collected. Some airlines do not permit connections and no airlines permit connections to different airlines. In Russia, a special official document is necessary that states that the child has permission to travel alone.\n\nSeat allocation is important. At a minimum you want to be seated next to your child, but few airlines will actually guarantee that you are. Make sure you and your child are on a single reservation. Try and reserve your seats in advance, if the airline or agent permit it. Check-in early, and if you are not seated together make sure the flight manager is aware you are travelling with a child.

St. Michael's Day was held on September 29th, and was a festival that shared many of the same features of Lughnasadh.\n\nWhen I recollect my childhood memories from Wales, I remember my family's celebration of this day and it always takes me back to the making of the Struan Micheil or Michael's Bannock.\n\nThe Struan Micheil was a special cake, more like a heavy bread, that was made from all of the different types of grain that were harvested during that time of year by my family from all around the surrounding area.\n\nI remember various large round loaves that were marked with deep crosses. These loaves were then fire cooked. Within my family, each woman's fire contained special sacred woods in which their loaves were baked. My grandmother's contained sacred oaks, rowan, and some various bramble wood that she loved the best because to her it smelled of the dark brambles or blackberries that it would soon harvest and was \"best\" for her fire and her bannock. I also remember how various women each spoke of the different ingredients they used and why. I also remember that I did not care for bannock made with sheep's milk!\n\nI have been blessed with having the awesome pleasure of owning my grandmother\u2018s bannock recipe which was willed to me and will one day be passed down to the next generation of my family.

In Ireland, the bannock is typically made from a wheat flour. Barley flours were used extensively in Wales. Bannock loaves provided a main staple food and were eaten at feasts as well as all of the daily meals. They acted as the prime form of breads and cakes in the days of old.\n\nDuring the times of the harvest, my grandmother made and put up as many loaves or cakes as she had enough flour to cook. All during September, she and the family cooked enough bannock loaves that would supply them throughout the harvest season, the coming Winter. and throughout most of the Spring.\n\nFolk tradition has it that the baker imbues each cake with a blessing during every stage of the bannock: mixing the ingredients, kneading the dough, leaving it to proof, baking the cake, and a special blessing if it was for a gift. Therefore, care must also be taken during this day in respect to how many cakes are cooked. I have also found that it is traditional for many in Ireland, Wales, and Scotland to bless each bannock as it is removed from the fire.\n\nAll day long my family baked.\n\nThere were also processions, songs to Michael, and horse racing in the afternoon that almost everyone attended.

In 1924 it was replaced by a Pratt truss footbridge, still in use.\nConstruction\nIn 1826, John Fitzgerald, the wealthy owner of Castle Irwell House (later to become the site of the Manchester Racecourse), built, at his own expense, a 144 feet (44 m) suspension bridge across the River Irwell between Lower Broughton and Pendleton. According to John Marius Wilson's Imperial Gazetteer of England and Wales (1870\u201372) all users of the bridge were required to pay a pontage to cross.[4] The bridge was the only means of communication between the townships of Broughton and Pendleton[5] and a source of great local pride, as the Menai Suspension Bridge had opened only that year and suspension bridges were then considered the \"new wonder of the age\".[6]\nCollapse\nOn 12 April 1831, the 60th Rifle Corps carried out an exercise on Kersal Moor under the command of Lieutenant Percy Slingsby Fitzgerald,[7] the son of John Fitzgerald, Member of Parliament and brother of the poet Edward FitzGerald.

{"prompt": "Where does this article tell me I can find foxes? \n\nWhere Do Foxes Live In Winter?\nExtremely adaptable, foxes live in various environments ranging from the forest, prairie, and tundra, to places inhabited by humans like farmlands and urban areas. As the fox\u2019s natural habitat disappears, they move into urban and suburban areas to look for food.\n\nFoxes are found on every continent except Antarctica.\n\nThere are at least 12 species, five of which live in the continental United States. Two types of foxes are most known for living in towns, cities, and other urban areas. The most common kinds of foxes you may see in your neighborhood are the Gray Fox and the Red Fox.\n\nIn Cities\nFoxes love habitats with lots of variety in vegetation and prey.\n\nThat is why they are often found on the edges of different ecosystems. For example, foxes love suburban areas because it is where the forest meets the city. These edge spaces provide more diversity in food and prey. \n\nFoxes aren\u2019t anything to be afraid of, however! Here\u2019s what to do if you see a fox in your yard.\n\nDens\nFoxes do not migrate long distances. Instead, they stay near home. To prepare for the birth of her kits, a female fox finds an enclosed shelter to inhabit or modify for her young. \n\nWhile the female fox may be a stay-at-home parent, the male is responsible for providing food for his growing family.\n\nOther Animals Shelter\nA fox may dig a den, but will likely steal shelter from other small mammals like rabbits or chipmunks.\n\nLike other predators, foxes will conserve their energy as necessary. If the work has already been completed, why waste time digging another den?\n\nHoles In The Ground\nA fox may commandeer a den from another small mammal, or they may find a natural hole in the ground to make their den.\n\nRainwater runoff that creates erosion as it flows downhill often hollows out loamy soil enough to create an open-air hole in the earth, perfect for a family of foxes in winter. \n\nHollowed Out Tree Stumps\nUnlike the red fox, a gray fox prefers above-ground dens, such as a hollowed-out tree stump. When a tree dies, it rots from the inside out, creating a perfectly insulated home to raise young and store food.\n\nIf you come across a fallen tree, look for a hollowed-out stump nearby. You might spot a fox family!\n\nRock Crevices\nIf your environment includes mountains or other rock formations, you may find your neighborhood fox living in a rock.\n\nTo humans, this may seem like a damp and dismal location for a home, but to a fox, a cave provides shelter from the elements and insulation from extreme temperatures.\n\nRock crevices are a common place to find foxes during the day.\n\nIn The Snow\nIf foxes do not have young ones to care for, they can sleep outside in the snow. Their thick fur keeps their skin warm and dry.\n\nIn addition, snow built up around and over the fox adds insulation and keeps the fox warm. \n\nFoxes are well suited to winter climates in their range; they prepare for winter by eating excess food and storing fat deposits on their body.\n\nAs a result, foxes are very comfortable in the snow!", "prompt_id": "e58c492d2ba9ec352b986e4cf9bb4f31add2a7a79173a59a45690f561309bd2e", "messages": [{"content": "Where does this article tell me I can find foxes? \n\nWhere Do Foxes Live In Winter?\nExtremely adaptable, foxes live in various environments ranging from the forest, prairie, and tundra, to places inhabited by humans like farmlands and urban areas.

Here\u2019s what to do if you see a fox in your yard.\n\nDens\nFoxes do not migrate long distances. Instead, they stay near home. To prepare for the birth of her kits, a female fox finds an enclosed shelter to inhabit or modify for her young. \n\nWhile the female fox may be a stay-at-home parent, the male is responsible for providing food for his growing family.\n\nOther Animals Shelter\nA fox may dig a den, but will likely steal shelter from other small mammals like rabbits or chipmunks.\n\nLike other predators, foxes will conserve their energy as necessary. If the work has already been completed, why waste time digging another den?\n\nHoles In The Ground\nA fox may commandeer a den from another small mammal, or they may find a natural hole in the ground to make their den.\n\nRainwater runoff that creates erosion as it flows downhill often hollows out loamy soil enough to create an open-air hole in the earth, perfect for a family of foxes in winter. \n\nHollowed Out Tree Stumps\nUnlike the red fox, a gray fox prefers above-ground dens, such as a hollowed-out tree stump. When a tree dies, it rots from the inside out, creating a perfectly insulated home to raise young and store food.\n\nIf you come across a fallen tree, look for a hollowed-out stump nearby. You might spot a fox family!\n\nRock Crevices\nIf your environment includes mountains or other rock formations, you may find your neighborhood fox living in a rock.\n\nTo humans, this may seem like a damp and dismal location for a home, but to a fox, a cave provides shelter from the elements and insulation from extreme temperatures.\n\nRock crevices are a common place to find foxes during the day.\n\nIn The Snow\nIf foxes do not have young ones to care for, they can sleep outside in the snow. Their thick fur keeps their skin warm and dry.\n\nIn addition, snow built up around and over the fox adds insulation and keeps the fox warm. \n\nFoxes are well suited to winter climates in their range; they prepare for winter by eating excess food and storing fat deposits on their body.\n\nAs a result, foxes are very comfortable in the snow!", "role": "user"}, {"content": "Foxes can be found in many environments including forests, prairies, tundras, farmlands, and urban regions near forests.

Potential identifications have also been made in Thailand, Vietnam, and Indonesia. The first remains of Gigantopithecus, two third molar teeth, were identified in a drugstore by anthropologist Ralph von Koenigswald in 1935, who subsequently described the ape. In 1956, the first mandible and more than 1,000 teeth were found in Liucheng, and numerous more remains have since been found in at least 16 sites. Only teeth and four mandibles are known currently, and other skeletal elements were likely consumed by porcupines before they could fossilise.[3] Gigantopithecus was once argued to be a hominin, a member of the human line, but it is now thought to be closely allied with orangutans, classified in the subfamily Ponginae.\n\nGigantopithecus has traditionally been restored as a massive, gorilla-like ape, potentially 200\u2013300 kg (440\u2013660 lb) when alive, but the paucity of remains make total size estimates highly speculative. The species may have been sexually dimorphic, with males much bigger than females. The incisors are reduced and the canines appear to have functioned like cheek teeth (premolars and molars). The premolars are high-crowned, and the fourth premolar is very molar-like. The molars are the largest of any known ape, and have a relatively flat surface.

It primarily lived in subtropical to tropical forest, and went extinct about 300,000 years ago likely because of the retreat of preferred habitat due to climate change, and potentially archaic human activity.

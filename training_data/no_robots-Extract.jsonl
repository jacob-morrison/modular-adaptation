{"prompt": "Go through the text below and extract the characteristics that Grover Cleveland won praise for. Present each characteristic on a separate line and in alphabetical order.\n\nStephen Grover Cleveland (March 18, 1837 \u2013 June 24, 1908) was an American lawyer and politician who served as the 22nd and 24th president of the United States from 1885 to 1889 and from 1893 to 1897. Cleveland is the only president in U.S. history to serve two non-consecutive presidential terms.[b] He won the popular vote in three presidential elections\u20141884, 1888, and 1892\u2014though Benjamin Harrison won the electoral college vote and thus the presidency in 1888. Cleveland was one of two Democrats elected president (followed by Woodrow Wilson in 1912) in an era when Republicans dominated the presidency between 1861 to 1933.\n\nIn 1881, Cleveland was elected mayor of Buffalo, and in 1882, he was elected governor of New York. He was the leader of the pro-business Bourbon Democrats who opposed high tariffs, free silver, inflation, imperialism, and subsidies to business, farmers, or veterans. His crusade for political reform and fiscal conservatism made him an icon for American conservatives of the era.[1] Cleveland won praise for his honesty, self-reliance, integrity, and commitment to the principles of classical liberalism.[2] He fought political corruption, patronage, and bossism. As a reformer, his prestige led many like-minded Republicans, called \"Mugwumps\", to bolt from the Republican Party's presidential ticket and swing their support to Cleveland during the 1884 election. Fifteen months into his first presidential term, he married Frances Folsom on June 2, 1886.[3] As his second administration began, disaster hit the nation when the Panic of 1893 produced a severe national depression. It ruined his Democratic Party, opening the way for a Republican landslide in 1894 and for the agrarian and silverite seizure of the Democratic Party in 1896. The result was a political realignment that ended the Third Party System and launched the Fourth Party System and the Progressive Era.[4]\n\nCleveland was a formidable policymaker, and he also drew corresponding criticism. His intervention in the Pullman Strike of 1894 to keep the railroads moving angered labor unions nationwide in addition to the party in Illinois; his support of the gold standard and opposition to free silver alienated the agrarian wing of the Democratic Party.[5] Critics complained that Cleveland had little imagination and seemed overwhelmed by the nation's economic disasters\u2014depressions and strikes\u2014in his second term.[5] Even so, his reputation for probity and good character survived the troubles of his second term. Biographer Allan Nevins wrote, \"[I]n Grover Cleveland, the greatness lies in typical rather than unusual qualities. He had no endowments that thousands of men do not have. He possessed honesty, courage, firmness, independence, and common sense.

Present each characteristic on a separate line and in alphabetical order.\n\nStephen Grover Cleveland (March 18, 1837 \u2013 June 24, 1908) was an American lawyer and politician who served as the 22nd and 24th president of the United States from 1885 to 1889 and from 1893 to 1897. Cleveland is the only president in U.S. history to serve two non-consecutive presidential terms.[b] He won the popular vote in three presidential elections\u20141884, 1888, and 1892\u2014though Benjamin Harrison won the electoral college vote and thus the presidency in 1888. Cleveland was one of two Democrats elected president (followed by Woodrow Wilson in 1912) in an era when Republicans dominated the presidency between 1861 to 1933.\n\nIn 1881, Cleveland was elected mayor of Buffalo, and in 1882, he was elected governor of New York. He was the leader of the pro-business Bourbon Democrats who opposed high tariffs, free silver, inflation, imperialism, and subsidies to business, farmers, or veterans. His crusade for political reform and fiscal conservatism made him an icon for American conservatives of the era.[1] Cleveland won praise for his honesty, self-reliance, integrity, and commitment to the principles of classical liberalism.[2] He fought political corruption, patronage, and bossism. As a reformer, his prestige led many like-minded Republicans, called \"Mugwumps\", to bolt from the Republican Party's presidential ticket and swing their support to Cleveland during the 1884 election. Fifteen months into his first presidential term, he married Frances Folsom on June 2, 1886.[3] As his second administration began, disaster hit the nation when the Panic of 1893 produced a severe national depression. It ruined his Democratic Party, opening the way for a Republican landslide in 1894 and for the agrarian and silverite seizure of the Democratic Party in 1896. The result was a political realignment that ended the Third Party System and launched the Fourth Party System and the Progressive Era.[4]\n\nCleveland was a formidable policymaker, and he also drew corresponding criticism. His intervention in the Pullman Strike of 1894 to keep the railroads moving angered labor unions nationwide in addition to the party in Illinois; his support of the gold standard and opposition to free silver alienated the agrarian wing of the Democratic Party.[5] Critics complained that Cleveland had little imagination and seemed overwhelmed by the nation's economic disasters\u2014depressions and strikes\u2014in his second term.[5] Even so, his reputation for probity and good character survived the troubles of his second term. Biographer Allan Nevins wrote, \"[I]n Grover Cleveland, the greatness lies in typical rather than unusual qualities. He had no endowments that thousands of men do not have. He possessed honesty, courage, firmness, independence, and common sense. But he possessed them to a degree other men do not.\"[6] By the end of his second term, public perception showed him to be one of the most unpopular U.S. presidents, and he was by then rejected even by most Democrats.[7] Today, Cleveland is considered by most historians to have been a successful leader, and has been praised for honesty, integrity, adherence to his morals, defying party boundaries, and effective leadership.\n\nStephen Grover Cleveland was born on March 18, 1837, in Caldwell, New Jersey, to Ann (n\u00e9e Neal) and Richard Falley Cleveland.[8] Cleveland's father was a Congregational and Presbyterian minister who was originally from Connecticut.[9] His mother was from Baltimore and was the daughter of a bookseller.[10] On his father's side, Cleveland was descended from English ancestors, the first of the family having emigrated to Massachusetts from Cleveland, England, in 1635.[11] His father's maternal grandfather, Richard Falley Jr., fought at the Battle of Bunker Hill, and was the son of an immigrant from Guernsey.

{"prompt": "Give me a bulleted list of the causes of the Hundred Years\u2019 War from this article:\nThe root causes of the conflict can be traced to the crisis of 14th-century Europe. The outbreak of war was motivated by a gradual rise in tension between the kings of France and England over territory; the official pretext was the question that arose because of the interruption of the direct male line of the Capetian dynasty.\nTensions between the French and English crowns had gone back centuries to the origins of the English royal family, which was French (Norman, and later, Angevin) in origin because of William the Conqueror, the Norman duke who became King of England in 1066. English monarchs had therefore historically held titles and lands within France, which made them vassals to the kings of France. The status of the English king's French fiefs was a major source of conflict between the two monarchies throughout the Middle Ages. French monarchs systematically sought to check the growth of English power, stripping away lands as the opportunity arose, particularly whenever England was at war with Scotland, an ally of France. English holdings in France had varied in size, at some points dwarfing even the French royal domain; by 1337, however, only Gascony was English.\nIn 1328, Charles IV of France died without any sons or brothers, and a new principle, Salic law, disallowed female succession. Charles's closest male relative was his nephew Edward III of England, whose mother, Isabella, was Charles's sister.

The outbreak of war was motivated by a gradual rise in tension between the kings of France and England over territory; the official pretext was the question that arose because of the interruption of the direct male line of the Capetian dynasty.\nTensions between the French and English crowns had gone back centuries to the origins of the English royal family, which was French (Norman, and later, Angevin) in origin because of William the Conqueror, the Norman duke who became King of England in 1066. English monarchs had therefore historically held titles and lands within France, which made them vassals to the kings of France. The status of the English king's French fiefs was a major source of conflict between the two monarchies throughout the Middle Ages. French monarchs systematically sought to check the growth of English power, stripping away lands as the opportunity arose, particularly whenever England was at war with Scotland, an ally of France. English holdings in France had varied in size, at some points dwarfing even the French royal domain; by 1337, however, only Gascony was English.\nIn 1328, Charles IV of France died without any sons or brothers, and a new principle, Salic law, disallowed female succession. Charles's closest male relative was his nephew Edward III of England, whose mother, Isabella, was Charles's sister. Isabella claimed the throne of France for her son by the rule of proximity of blood, but the French nobility rejected this, maintaining that Isabella could not transmit a right she did not possess.

{"prompt": "Make a comma-separated list of all jobs or occupations mentioned in the following article that are affected by products containing toxic chemicals.\nHere is the article to reference:\n\nConsumer products released more than 5,000 tons of chemicals in 2020 inside California homes and workplaces that are known to cause cancer, adversely affect sexual function and fertility in adults or harm developing fetuses, according to our newly published study.\n\nWe found that many household products like shampoos, body lotions, cleaners and mothballs release toxic volatile organic compounds, or VOCs, into indoor air. In addition, we identified toxic VOCs that are prevalent in products heavily used by workers on the job, such as cleaning fluids, adhesives, paint removers and nail polish. However, gaps in laws that govern ingredient disclosure mean that neither consumers nor workers generally know what is in the products they use.\n\nFor this study we analyzed data from the California Air Resources Board (CARB), which tracks VOCs released from consumer products in an effort to reduce smog. The agency periodically surveys companies that sell products in California, collecting information on concentrations of VOCs used in everything from hair spray to windshield wiper fluid.\n\nAnalysis of the world, from experts\nWe cross-referenced the most recent data with a list of chemicals identified as carcinogens or reproductive/developmental toxicants under California\u2019s right-to-know law, Proposition 65. This measure, enacted in 1986, requires businesses to notify Californians about significant exposure to chemicals that are known to cause cancer, birth defects or other reproductive harms.\n\nWe found 33 toxic VOCs present in consumer products. Over 100 consumer products covered by the CARB contain VOCs listed under Prop 65.\n\nOf these, we identified 30 product types and 11 chemicals that we see as high priorities for either reformulation with safer alternatives or regulatory action because of the chemicals\u2019 high toxicity and widespread use.\n\n\nWhy it matters\nOur study identifies consumer products containing carcinogens and reproductive and developmental toxicants that are widely used at home and in the workplace. Consumers have limited information about these products\u2019 ingredients.\n\nWe also found that people are likely co-exposed to many hazardous chemicals together as mixtures through use of many different products, which often contain many chemicals of health concern. For example, janitors might use a combination of general cleaners, degreasers, detergents and other maintenance products. This could expose them to more than 20 different Prop 65-listed VOCs.\n\nSimilarly, people experience aggregate exposures to the same chemical from multiple sources. Methanol, which is listed under Prop 65 for developmental toxicity, was found in 58 product categories. Diethanolamine, a chemical frequently used in products like shampoos that are creamy or foamy, appeared in 40 different product categories. Canada and the European Union prohibit its use in cosmetics because it can react with other ingredients to form chemicals that may cause cancer.\n\nSome chemicals, such as N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone and ethylene gylcol, are listed under Prop 65 because they are reproductive or developmental toxicants. Yet they appeared widely in goods such as personal care products, cleansers and art supplies that are routinely used by children or people who are pregnant.\n\nOur findings could help state and federal agencies strengthen chemical regulations. We identified five chemicals \u2013 cumene, 1,3-dichloropropene, diethanolamine, ethylene oxide and styrene \u2013 as high-priority targets for risk evaluation and management under the Toxic Substances Control Act by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.\n\nA hotel housekeeper stands next to her cart, piled with towels and bottled cleaning supplies.\nMany jobs, including custodian and hotel housekeeper, involve close-range exposure to multiple chemicals daily. Jeff Greenberg/Universal Images Group via Getty Images\nWhat still isn\u2019t known\nOur analysis of the CARB data on volatile toxicants does not paint a complete picture. Many toxic chemicals, such as lead, PFAS and bisphenol A (BPA), don\u2019t have to be reported to the Air Resources Board because they are not volatile, meaning that they don\u2019t readily turn from liquid to gas at room temperature.\n\nIn addition, we were not able to identify specific products of concern because the agency aggregates data over whole categories of products.\n\nWhat other research is being done\nStudies have shown that women generally use more cosmetic, personal care and cleaning products than men, so they are likely to be more highly exposed to harmful chemicals in these categories. Further, women working in settings like nail salons may be exposed from products used both personally and professionally.\n\nResearch by members of our team has also shown that product use varies by race and ethnicity, partly due to racialized beauty standards. Policy interventions could be tailored to prioritize these potentially more-highly exposed groups.\n\nUltimately, a right-to-know law like Prop 65 can only go so far in addressing toxics in products. We\u2019ve found in other research that some manufacturers do choose to reformulate their products to avoid Prop 65 chemicals, rather than having to warn customers about toxic ingredients.\n\nBut Prop 65 does not ban or restrict any chemicals, and there is no requirement for manufacturers to choose safer substitutes. We believe our new analysis points to the need for national action that ensures consumers and workers alike have safer products.", "prompt_id": "5d111125d02e9d2c35a88c2417e4e27fb16caf5ffd744636b7949845b102995a", "messages": [{"content": "Make a comma-separated list of all jobs or occupations mentioned in the following article that are affected by products containing toxic chemicals.\nHere is the article to reference:\n\nConsumer products released more than 5,000 tons of chemicals in 2020 inside California homes and workplaces that are known to cause cancer, adversely affect sexual function and fertility in adults or harm developing fetuses, according to our newly published study.\n\nWe found that many household products like shampoos, body lotions, cleaners and mothballs release toxic volatile organic compounds, or VOCs, into indoor air.

The power vacuum following Saddam's demise, and mismanagement by the Coalition Provisional Authority, led to widespread civil war between Shias and Sunnis, as well as a lengthy insurgency against coalition forces. The United States responded with a build-up of 170,000 troops in 2007.[56] This build-up gave greater control to Iraq's government and military.[57] In 2008, President Bush agreed to a withdrawal of all US combat troops from Iraq. The withdrawal was completed under Barack Obama in December 2011.[58][59]", "role": "user"}, {"content": "Iraq, the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, Poland ", "role": "assistant"}], "category": "Extract"}

{"prompt": "Extract the ingredients for a facial moisturizer in this article and present them in a numbered list. \n\n1. Hyaluronic Acid\nIt\u2019s an ingredient that is currently all the rage in skincare, but it\u2019s so much more than just a trend. Hyaluronic acid is a literal hydration lifesaver because it can hold about 1,000 times its weight in water. This type of acid acts as a humectant, a potent ingredient that\u2019s basically a sponge, pulling in water and coating your complexion with the hydration it so desperately needs. Adding hyaluronic acid to your moisturizing routine will result in plump, supple, and youthful skin. Want to know even more about hyaluronic acid? You\u2019re in luck. We have an entire article about it right here!\n\n2. Essential Oils\nEssential oils are very trendy at the moment, but their benefits go far beyond their current rage. Most of the essential oils that are used in skincare are fatty acids that will absorb on skin surfaces quickly and effectively, providing ample moisture that won\u2019t dry out and a smoother, creamier complexion. There are plenty of essential oils out there that are often included in moisturizers, but a few of our favorite (and a few of the most effective) include oils like jojoba, avocado, kukui nut, rosehip, calendula, argan, apricot kernel, and more. Typically, oils can be used inside a moisturizing product or added into a moisturizing product through a serum drop.\n\n3. Ceramides\nIf you\u2019ve never heard of ceramides, don\u2019t fret\u2014that\u2019s why we\u2019re here. Ceramides are long chains of skin lipids that are already a part of your skin\u2019s outer layer. So, adding extra ceramides to your skincare routine helps to increase and reinforce your skin\u2019s natural moisture barrier. When you add ceramide moisturizers into your routine, you ensure that your skin\u2019s surface is hydrated and that you\u2019re creating a protective barrier that will keep environmental pollutants out.\n\n4. Glycerin\nLike Hyaluronic acid, Glycerin is a humectant-like ingredient that helps to attract and lock in important moisture on your skin\u2019s surface.  Many moisturizing products out there already include glycerin, but we suggest double checking all labels to ensure your moisturizer has a healthy dose of this ingredient. Glycerin helps to hydrate dried out, thirsty skin and aims to leave skin surfaces feeling soft, younger, and more supple.\n\n5. Sunscreen Or Sun Blocking Agents\nNo, a great moisturizer doesn\u2019t always include a solid sun-blocking agent in it (especially since sunscreen isn\u2019t a key ingredient in most moisturizing products). But we offer major bonus points to moisturizers that include a dash of sun protection in them. No, this won\u2019t necessarily rescue your dry, damaged skin, and no, it won\u2019t keep your skin well-hydrated, but it will help to prevent any further dryness, redness, or damage from the sun\u2014and why wouldn\u2019t you want to add that in as an effective moisturizer ingredient?\n\nShare this post\nShare on Facebook\nShare on Twitter\nShare on Pinterest\nShare on LinkedIn\nPost Navigation\nPREVIOUS\nPrevious post:\nChemical Peel 101: The Fundamentals\nNEXT\nNext post:\nVitamin C Serum: A Skin Care Cornerstone\n1 COMMENT\nPingback: Our Top 5: The Hottest Skincare Trends of 2020 to Keep Your Eye On. | Spa De Soleil Private Label Blog\nLEAVE A REPLY\nYou must be logged in to post a comment.\n\nFORMULA CATEGORIES\nBody Wash (2)\nCertified Organic (1)\nCosmetic Wipes (3)\nER Treatments (2)\nEye & Lip Treatment (7)\nEye Treatment (1)\nFace Cleanser (17)\nFace Cream (29)\nFace Mask (15)\nFace Mist (1)\nFace Oil (3)\nFace Scrub (4)\nFace Serum (11)\nFace Toner (12)\nFacial Pads (2)\nFormulation Library (10)\nAHA & BHA (4)\nAnti-Aging Essentials (1)\nBody Scrub (5)\nHair Shampoo (1)\nHand & Body (5)\nLotion (3)\nMen's Collection (3)\nOTC (Over-the-Counter) (1)\nRetinol (3)", "prompt_id": "9be232867a3e74aa79e29b4dabed8bf020108cab509cac2ea7f91f2630846704", "messages": [{"content": "Extract the ingredients for a facial moisturizer in this article and present them in a numbered list. \n\n1.

The worst of this was that King Leopold III of Belgium surrendered to the Germans on May 28 without warning his allies, exposing the entire flank of the Allied forces to German panzer groups.[44] Following the conquest of the Low Countries, Hitler occupied Denmark and Norway, beginning on April 9, 1940. Norway was strategically important because of its sea routes which supplied crucial Swedish ore to the Nazi war machine.

The worst of this was that King Leopold III of Belgium surrendered to the Germans on May 28 without warning his allies, exposing the entire flank of the Allied forces to German panzer groups.[44] Following the conquest of the Low Countries, Hitler occupied Denmark and Norway, beginning on April 9, 1940.

Produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures,[a] it is the sixth film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). Written and directed by Joss Whedon, the film features an ensemble cast including Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Hemsworth, Scarlett Johansson, and Jeremy Renner as the Avengers, alongside Tom Hiddleston, Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd, and Samuel L. Jackson. In the film, Nick Fury and the spy agency S.H.I.E.L.D. recruit Tony Stark, Steve Rogers, Bruce Banner, Thor, Natasha Romanoff, and Clint Barton to form a team capable of stopping Thor's brother Loki from subjugating Earth.\n\nThe film's development began when Marvel Studios received a loan from Merrill Lynch in April 2005. After the success of the film Iron Man in May 2008, Marvel announced that The Avengers would be released in July 2011 and would bring together Stark (Downey), Rogers (Evans), Banner (at the time Edward Norton),[b] and Thor (Hemsworth) from Marvel's previous films. With the signing of Johansson as Romanoff in March 2009, Renner as Barton in June 2010, and Ruffalo replacing Norton as Banner in July 2010, the film was pushed back for a 2012 release. Whedon was brought on board in April 2010 and rewrote the original screenplay by Zak Penn. Production began in April 2011 in Albuquerque, New Mexico, before moving to Cleveland, Ohio in August and New York City in September. The film has more than 2,200 visual effects shots.\n\nThe Avengers premiered in Los Angeles on April 11, 2012, and was released in the United States on May 4, as the final film in Phase One of the MCU.

The film grossed over $1.5 billion worldwide, setting numerous box office records and becoming the third-highest-grossing film of all time at the time of its release and the highest-grossing film of 2012, as well as the first Marvel production to generate $1 billion in ticket sales. In 2017, The Avengers was featured as one of the 100 greatest films of all time in an Empire magazine poll.

Keller became the first woman in the United States to earn a Ph.D. in computer science in 1965, after previously earning degrees in math and physics from DePaul University.\nShe also completed graduate work at other universities, including at Dartmouth College's computer lab, which typically excluded women at that time. While at Dartmouth, Keller helped develop the BASIC programming language, which made coding more accessible to people in fields beyond math and science.\nAfter graduating with her Ph.D. from the University of Wisconsin Madison, she founded the department of computer science at Clark University in Iowa and remained there for about 18 years. Keller worked to attract more women to the computer science field and invited students to bring their children to class.\n\nMargaret Hamilton\nMargaret Hamilton played a key role in helping astronauts land on the moon. Creator of the term \"software engineer,\" Hamilton was one of the first computer software programmers.\nShe earned a bachelor's degree in mathematics from Earlham College in 1958. After graduating, she got a job at MIT to help support her family while her husband attended law school. While there, she taught herself programming and created software to aid in predictive meteorology.\nIn the late 1960s and early 1970s, she wrote code for the onboard software that made Apollo missions to the moon possible. She was the first computer programmer and woman that NASA hired to work on the Apollo project.\nShe received the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2016 from President Barack Obama to acknowledge her role in the Apollo moon missions. LEGO immortalized her and a few other NASA women by creating figurines of their likenesses in 2017.\n\nAdele Goldberg\nBorn in 1945 in Ohio, Adele Goldberg liked math from an early age. She earned a bachelor's degree in math from the University of Michigan and worked at IBM in the summer between her junior and senior years.\nWhile at IBM, Goldberg taught herself to program unit record machines and began considering a career in computing. In 1973, she completed a Ph.D. in information science from the University of Chicago.\nAfter graduating, she started working at Xerox's Palo Alto Research Center, where she helped develop Smalltalk, an object-oriented programming language. Smalltalk was one of the first programming languages that could create graphic user interfaces like menus, icons, and windows.\nGoldberg co-founded ParcPlace Systems and later created a consultancy group.

{"prompt": "Put each sentence that has the word 'bat' or 'bats' into a bulleted list from the following paragraph. Remove any bracketed numbers. \n\nThe 2003 discovery of an early fossil bat from the 52-million-year-old Green River Formation, Onychonycteris finneyi, indicates that flight evolved before echolocative abilities.[20][21] Onychonycteris had claws on all five of its fingers, whereas modern bats have at most two claws on two digits of each hand. It also had longer hind legs and shorter forearms, similar to climbing mammals that hang under branches, such as sloths and gibbons.

Use the last relationship to King Henry.\n\nBorn on 28 June 1491 at the Palace of Placentia in Greenwich, Kent, Henry Tudor was the third child and second son of King Henry VII and Elizabeth of York.[4] Of the young Henry's six (or seven) siblings, only three \u2013 his brother Arthur, Prince of Wales, and sisters Margaret and Mary \u2013 survived infancy.[5] He was baptised by Richard Foxe, the Bishop of Exeter, at a church of the Observant Franciscans close to the palace.[6] In 1493, at the age of two, Henry was appointed Constable of Dover Castle and Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports. He was subsequently appointed Earl Marshal of England and Lord Lieutenant of Ireland at age three and was made a Knight of the Bath soon after. The day after the ceremony, he was created Duke of York and a month or so later made Warden of the Scottish Marches. In May 1495, he was appointed to the Order of the Garter. The reason for giving such appointments to a small child was to enable his father to retain personal control of lucrative positions and not share them with established families.[6] Not much is known about Henry's early life \u2013 save for his appointments \u2013 because he was not expected to become king,[6] but it is known that he received a first-rate education from leading tutors. He became fluent in Latin and French and learned at least some Italian.[7][8]\n\nIn November 1501, Henry played a considerable part in the ceremonies surrounding his brother Arthur's marriage to Catherine, the youngest child of King Ferdinand II of Aragon and Queen Isabella I of Castile.[9] As Duke of York, Henry used the arms of his father as king, differenced by a label of three points ermine. He was further honoured on 9 February 1506 by Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian I, who made him a Knight of the Golden Fleece.[10]\n\nIn 1502, Arthur died at the age of 15, possibly of sweating sickness,[11] just 20 weeks after his marriage to Catherine.[12] Arthur's death thrust all his duties upon his younger brother. The 10-year-old Henry became the new Duke of Cornwall, and the new Prince of Wales and Earl of Chester in February 1504.[13] Henry VII gave his second son few responsibilities even after the death of Arthur. Young Henry was strictly supervised and did not appear in public. As a result, he ascended the throne \"untrained in the exacting art of kingship\".[14]\n\nHenry VII renewed his efforts to seal a marital alliance between England and Spain, by offering his son Henry in marriage to the widowed Catherine.[12] Both Henry VII and Catherine's mother Queen Isabella were keen on the idea, which had arisen very shortly after Arthur's death.[15] On 23 June 1503, a treaty was signed for their marriage, and they were betrothed two days later.[16] A papal dispensation was only needed for the \"impediment of public honesty\" if the marriage had not been consummated as Catherine and her duenna claimed, but Henry VII and the Spanish ambassador set out instead to obtain a dispensation for \"affinity\", which took account of the possibility of consummation.[16] Cohabitation was not possible because Henry was too young.[15] Isabella's death in 1504, and the ensuing problems of succession in Castile, complicated matters. Catherine's father Ferdinand preferred her to stay in England, but Henry VII's relations with Ferdinand had deteriorated.[17] Catherine was therefore left in limbo for some time, culminating in Prince Henry's rejection of the marriage as soon he was able, at the age of 14.

Her headmaster at St Michael's, Alfred Dunn, has been suggested as the inspiration for the Harry Potter headmaster Albus Dumbledore.\n\nAs a child, Rowling often wrote fantasy stories, which she would usually then read to her sister. She recalls that: \"I can still remember me telling her a story in which she fell down a rabbit hole and was fed strawberries by the rabbit family inside it.

{"prompt": "Extract the section below titled \"Whitening toothpastes\" and include the title:\n\nAlteration of taste perception\nAfter using toothpaste, orange juice, and other fruit juices are known to have an unpleasant taste if consumed shortly afterwards. Sodium lauryl sulfate, used as a surfactant in toothpaste, alters taste perception. It can break down phospholipids that inhibit taste receptors for sweetness, giving food a bitter taste. In contrast, apples are known to taste more pleasant after using toothpaste.[69] Distinguishing between the hypotheses that the bitter taste of orange juice results from stannous fluoride or from sodium lauryl sulfate is still an unresolved issue and it is thought that the menthol added for flavor may also take part in the alteration of taste perception when binding to lingual cold receptors.[citation needed]\n\nWhitening toothpastes\nMany toothpastes make whitening claims. Some of these toothpastes contain peroxide, the same ingredient found in tooth-bleaching gels. The abrasive in these toothpastes, not the peroxide, removes the stains.[citation needed] Whitening toothpaste cannot alter the natural color of teeth or reverse discoloration by penetrating surface stains or decay. To remove surface stains, whitening toothpaste may include abrasives to gently polish the teeth or additives such as sodium tripolyphosphate to break down or dissolve stains. When used twice a day, whitening toothpaste typically takes two to four weeks to make teeth appear whiter. Whitening toothpaste is generally safe for daily use, but excessive use might damage tooth enamel.

Sodium lauryl sulfate, used as a surfactant in toothpaste, alters taste perception. It can break down phospholipids that inhibit taste receptors for sweetness, giving food a bitter taste. In contrast, apples are known to taste more pleasant after using toothpaste.[69] Distinguishing between the hypotheses that the bitter taste of orange juice results from stannous fluoride or from sodium lauryl sulfate is still an unresolved issue and it is thought that the menthol added for flavor may also take part in the alteration of taste perception when binding to lingual cold receptors.[citation needed]\n\nWhitening toothpastes\nMany toothpastes make whitening claims.

(Photo by Thomas Trutschel/Photothek via Getty Images)\nImage Credits: Thomas Trutschel / Getty Images\nCloud storage giant Dropbox today joined the fray of tech companies announcing layoffs. The company today announced that it would be laying off 16% of its staff, equivalent to about 500 employees, due to slowing growth, and \u2014 in the words of CEO Drew Houston \u2014 because \u201cthe AI era of computing has finally arrived.\u201d\n\nThese appear to be the first layoffs the company has made since January 2021, when it laid off 315 employees in the throes of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe latest cull was announced to staff in a memo from CEO and co-founder Drew Houston, as well as in an SEC filing.\n\n\nThe SEC filing noted that the company will incur charges of approximately $37 million to $42 million in connection with layoffs, which will be recorded in Q2. Q1 results, which will be reported next Thursday, May 4, will be in-line or even above expectations, it added.\n\nIronically, even with the strong results, and the fact that Dropbox is profitable, Houston said the company is choosing to take a preemptive step to cut jobs and invest in new areas to keep up with the pace of change, given that growth is slowing.\n\n\u201cWhile our business is profitable, our growth has been slowing. Part of this is due to the natural maturation of our existing businesses, but more recently, headwinds from the economic downturn have put pressure on our customers and, in turn, on our business. As a result, some investments that used to deliver positive returns are no longer sustainable,\u201d he wrote.\n\nThe interesting thing is that he also cites AI as a major factor.\n\n\n\u201cSecond, and more consequentially, the AI era of computing has finally arrived,\u201d he continued. \u201cWe\u2019ve believed for many years that AI will give us new superpowers and completely transform knowledge work. And we\u2019ve been building towards this future for a long time, as this year\u2019s product pipeline will demonstrate.\u201d\n\n\nFor those who have been warning that AI will inevitably lead to the loss of more jobs, this will come as an alarming development. The more cynical might argue that it\u2019s an easy and timely excuse for cutting costs right now, to keep the market and investors optimistic that Dropbox is changing with the times and itself won\u2019t get disrupted in the next wave of innovation.\n\nHouston said that impacted staff will be getting notified today and will be finished with work by tomorrow.

(Photo by Thomas Trutschel/Photothek via Getty Images)\nImage Credits: Thomas Trutschel / Getty Images\nCloud storage giant Dropbox today joined the fray of tech companies announcing layoffs. The company today announced that it would be laying off 16% of its staff, equivalent to about 500 employees, due to slowing growth, and \u2014 in the words of CEO Drew Houston \u2014 because \u201cthe AI era of computing has finally arrived.\u201d\n\nThese appear to be the first layoffs the company has made since January 2021, when it laid off 315 employees in the throes of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe latest cull was announced to staff in a memo from CEO and co-founder Drew Houston, as well as in an SEC filing.\n\n\nThe SEC filing noted that the company will incur charges of approximately $37 million to $42 million in connection with layoffs, which will be recorded in Q2. Q1 results, which will be reported next Thursday, May 4, will be in-line or even above expectations, it added.\n\nIronically, even with the strong results, and the fact that Dropbox is profitable, Houston said the company is choosing to take a preemptive step to cut jobs and invest in new areas to keep up with the pace of change, given that growth is slowing.\n\n\u201cWhile our business is profitable, our growth has been slowing. Part of this is due to the natural maturation of our existing businesses, but more recently, headwinds from the economic downturn have put pressure on our customers and, in turn, on our business. As a result, some investments that used to deliver positive returns are no longer sustainable,\u201d he wrote.\n\nThe interesting thing is that he also cites AI as a major factor.\n\n\n\u201cSecond, and more consequentially, the AI era of computing has finally arrived,\u201d he continued. \u201cWe\u2019ve believed for many years that AI will give us new superpowers and completely transform knowledge work. And we\u2019ve been building towards this future for a long time, as this year\u2019s product pipeline will demonstrate.\u201d\n\n\nFor those who have been warning that AI will inevitably lead to the loss of more jobs, this will come as an alarming development. The more cynical might argue that it\u2019s an easy and timely excuse for cutting costs right now, to keep the market and investors optimistic that Dropbox is changing with the times and itself won\u2019t get disrupted in the next wave of innovation.\n\nHouston said that impacted staff will be getting notified today and will be finished with work by tomorrow. The company had 3,125 employees prior to the move today.\n\nMore than 184,000 people have been laid off in the tech sector in 2023 across nearly 620 tech companies, according to the Layoffs.fyi tracker.\n\nMore to come.\n\n----\n\n\n", "role": "user"}, {"content": "500, 16%, 315, 19, 37, 42, 2, 1, 3125, 184000, 620", "role": "assistant"}], "category": "Extract"}

{"prompt": "Extract from this text the exact years mentioned and why each is mentioned. \n\nA small number of meteorite falls have been observed with automated cameras and recovered following calculation of the impact point. The first of these was the P\u0159ibram meteorite, which fell in Czechoslovakia (now the Czech Republic) in 1959.[42] In this case, two cameras used to photograph meteors captured images of the fireball. The images were used both to determine the location of the stones on the ground and, more significantly, to calculate for the first time an accurate orbit for a recovered meteorite.\n\nFollowing the Pribram fall, other nations established automated observing programs aimed at studying infalling meteorites.

In 1971, Jon Landau wrote in Rolling Stone that the sound consisted of songs with simple structures but sophisticated melodies, along with a four-beat drum pattern, regular use of horns and strings, and \"a trebly style of mixing that relied heavily on electronic limiting and equalizing (boosting the high range frequencies) to give the overall product a distinctive sound, particularly effective for broadcast over AM radio\".[49] Pop production techniques such as the use of orchestral string sections, charted horn sections, and carefully arranged background vocals were also used. Complex arrangements and elaborate, melismatic vocal riffs were avoided.[50] Motown producers believed steadfastly in the \"KISS principle\" (keep it simple, stupid).[51]\n\nThe Motown production process has been described as factory-like.

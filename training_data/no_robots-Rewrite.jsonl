Dog owners must be very careful when using oil diffusers in their homes, particularly ones containing tea tree oil. Tea tree oil can be lethal for dogs.\n\nA New Zealand grandmother shared a heartbreaking story about how her beloved pooch was poisoned by the oils in her diffuser. The poor dog was left unable to recognise her when she returned from working a late shift as a nanny. It is great that Marrianne Whyte shared her warning on Facebook because it raises awareness of this issue. In fact, her post has been shared 1.5 million times.\n\nWhen she tried to wake her dog up, she thought the dog had been having a dream, or been experiencing night terrors. However, she found that he was \"still acting weird\" the next day. The following day Marrianne set off for another shift but had to return home early after receiving a worrying call from her dog sitter because the dog wouldn't come out from under the bed. It was very out of character because he was a happy dog. After returning early from work Marrianne Whyte found the dog in a confused state, so she took him to the emergency vet. \n\nIt was then she discovered that the tea tree oil in her diffuser is toxic for dogs. There is a happy ending to the story, because fortunately, tests confirmed that Marriane's dog hadn't suffered liver damage. However, the vet gave him fluids under his skin to get rid of any toxins. Cat lovers should also be aware, as Vet Clinic Pets on Parker, so rightly points out. Cats are also at risk of being poisoned by essential oils. Cats don't have a liver enzyme called glucuronyl transferase, which is required to break them down. Cats' livers are slower at eliminating these compounds, which can lead to toxic build-up. \n\nDogs, like me, do not lack this enzyme, but we are still sensitive to essential oils and we are liable to become very sick if exposed to them. Owners can look out for common signs of poisoning as a result of inhalation from an oil diffuser, by watching for laboured breathing, lack of coordination and difficulty walking, drooling, diarrhoea, lethargy, depression, low body temperature, weakness, muscle tremors and vomiting.\n\nTherefore, you see the terrible effects that these diffusers can have on animals like me. I thank you for highlighting and raising awareness of this problem. I hope that no other dog will have to suffer as a result of tea tree oil diffusers.\n\nRegards,\nRolo the dog", "role": "assistant"}], "category": "Rewrite"}

A nonstick muffin tin is recommended, but brush the tin with mild-tasting olive oil just to be safe.\n\nThe first step is to combine the dry ingredients in a medium size bowl. Start with one-and-a-half cups of whole-wheat pastry flour, one-half cups, at pastry flour. If you don't have it in your pantry, you can use white whole-wheat flour or three-quarter cups (100 grams) of all-purpose flour and whole-wheat flour. Two teaspoons of baking powder provide the leavening in this recipe. Follow this with one-half teaspoon of freshly ground black pepper and one-quarter teaspoon of fine salt. Briefly whisk the ingredients together to combine them.\n\nIn a larger bowl, whisk the wet ingredients: two-thirds cup (180 milliliters of whole or reduced-fat milk or plant-based milk; one half-up (113 grams) of plain Greek yogurt, one large egg, and one teaspoon of honey.  Once these ingredients are well combined, add the flour mixture. Stir the wet and dry ingredients together, but only until just combined.  \n\nFor the primary flavoring, gently stir in four ounces (115 grams) of fresh crumbled goat cheese, also sold as chevre and one half-cup of finely chopped fresh chives. \n\nAfter the batter is done, divide it equally between the muffin tin cups. Each cup should be about three-quarters full. Using a one-quarter measuring cup as a scoop is a good guide.\n\nFrom here, the muffins go into the preheated oven. We are looking for golden-brown muffin tops, which should take about 18 to 20 minutes. You will know the muffins are done when an inserted toothpick or cake tester comes out clean. Transfer the tin to a wire rack to add in cooling. After five to ten minutes use a butter knife or offset spatula to remove the muffins.  \n\nThese tasty muffins are best served warm. Enjoy!\n\n\n\n\n", "role": "assistant"}], "category": "Rewrite"}

Its primary mission was not just to click eye-catching images of the universe, but also to unravel the mysteries of celestial bodies ranging from our nearest satellite, the moon, to the farthest galaxies.\n\nThis tale, however, started long before Hubble's epic space odyssey, when Galileo Galilei aimed a simple spyglass at the stars in 1610. Despite the blurry images and the immense difficulty in discerning Saturn's rings, it laid the groundwork for future explorations.\n\nAfter World War II, an astronomer named Lyman Spitzer dreamed about a telescope free from the clutches of atmospheric distortion. But it wasn't until the late 1960s that his idea gained traction. Led by Spitzer, a group of distinguished scientists compiled a document underlining the scientific potential of a Large Space Telescope.\n\nThe proposal caught the attention of NASA, the only organization capable of realizing such an ambitious project. Even though they were already considering a space telescope, they needed guidance on its size and the starting point. Following an endorsement from George Low, the acting administrator at that time, the Large Space Telescope project received an official nod.\n\nHowever, convincing the House Appropriations Subcommittee to fund this costly endeavor wasn't easy, and they initially turned down the request in 1975. Not deterred, NASA redoubled its efforts and enlisted the European Space Agency to share the burden of cost. Their persistence paid off when they secured funding from Congress in 1977.\n\nWith the green light shining brightly, NASA jumped into action, planning to launch the telescope in 1983. But a series of delays postponed the launch date until 1986. Meanwhile, the Large Space Telescope was christened \"Hubble,\" in tribute to Edwin Hubble, the American astronomer who confirmed the universe's expansiveness beyond the Milky Way.\n\nAn unfortunate incident, the explosion of the space shuttle Challenger in 1986, which resulted in the loss of seven astronauts, further delayed Hubble's launch. It took more than two years for NASA to recover and resume planning for Hubble's journey.\n\nFinally, on April 24, 1990, the Hubble Space Telescope was launched into low Earth orbit by the space shuttle Discovery, where it now resides 340 miles above the Earth. Despite costing $1.5 billion to develop and launch, the astronomical payoff of Hubble's invaluable scientific contributions has been worth every cent.", "role": "assistant"}], "category": "Rewrite"}

The blinding glow of infernal lights illuminated the cursed domain, casting sinister shadows that danced along the walls. Demonic guards, with their razor-sharp horns and sulfurous breath, slammed their truncheons against the metal bunks, jolting the imprisoned souls from their fitful slumber. The air echoed with their spine-chilling screams as they bellowed orders.\n\nAmidst the clamor, the souls rose from their charred resting places, their eyes filled with a haunting despair. With trepidation, they lined up in their cubicles, their gazes fixed straight ahead, awaiting the morning count. The guards, grotesque demons with smoldering eyes, conducted the ritualistic inspection, ensuring the presence of every damned soul. Time seemed to crawl as the wretched captives shuffled through the dimly lit corridors, hurrying to the fetid latrines. In the absence of mirrors, they spared themselves the torment of seeing their wretched visages, their heads shaven clean, a stark symbol of their damned existence.\n\nClad in threadbare garments, the souls marched outside, braving the oppressive heat that enveloped the infernal realm. They converged with other platoons on the scorched parade grounds, a desolate expanse where their infernal punishments took shape. The platoon captain, a towering demon with bat-like wings, addressed the tormented gathering, his voice dripping with malice.\n\n\"Welcome to the training grounds of eternal suffering,\" the platoon captain snarled, his voice resonating through the sulfurous air. \"Here, you will endure physical torment that matches the depths of your sins. You will run, you will sweat, and you will learn the true meaning of despair.\"\n\nAs the platoon captain continued his diabolic sermon, the souls stood motionless, their minds clouded with a mix of fear and resignation. The captain recited a haunting mantra, a twisted creed of survival within the infernal abyss.\n\n\"In the fiery depths of Hell, there is no rest for the weak,\" the captain proclaimed, his voice echoing with sadistic delight. \"Every soul must strive to outpace their fellow tormentor or risk descending further into the abyss. Whether you be demon or damned, heed my words\u2014when the flames rise, you must run.\"\n\nAnd so, they ran. The main character, their spirit weary and broken, dragged themselves along, their every step burdened with the weight of their sins. The demonic guards, their monstrous forms towering over the tortured souls, barked commands and lashed out with fiery whips, their taunts and jeers fueling the captives' desperate resolve. The main character, their head throbbing with infernal pain, pushed forward, an embodiment of defiance amid the relentless torment.\n\nThe midday respite brought no reprieve from their anguish. Instead, they were subjected to another vile meal\u2014nauseating concoctions served on tarnished platters. The platoon captain, a demon of sadistic delight, introduced the \"Stripes of Shame\" with malevolent glee. The striped garments, adorned with hellish symbols of punishment, served as a constant reminder of their fallen status. The platoon captain's words dripped with venom as they explained the purpose of these garments\u2014to humiliate, degrade, and remind the condemned souls of their eternal damnation.\n\nChained and silenced, the souls were led like a procession of broken spirits, their striped smocks billowing in the sulfurous wind. They were herded into the accursed wagons, their limbs shackled to one another, their every movement restricted. It was during this treacherous journey, bound by the chains of their collective misery, that the main character encountered Julie Martin, a soul ensnared by her association with a wretched lover. \n\nThey found solace in their shared predicament, a glimmer of camaraderie amidst the labyrinth of damned souls.

I've got some tips to share for anyone looking to change up things around the house and make it more lively. First: you don't need to focus on big changes! There are lots of things you can do that can make a big impact with a small investment. Here are a few:\n\nNew light fixtures (even standing or tabletop ones) can easily change the mood of a room, especially with the options at your disposal. Consider dimmable lights, RGB lights, or candelabra fixtures for example. A porch swing or other outdoor furniture can inspire you to spend more of your time outside, making a cozier environment to be in. Both of these are just scratching the surface of some of the relatively low-cost and low-effort improvements you can make at home. Something as simple as changing the layout of a room can make a big difference, too. It can change the way you manage your routine, or your workflow if you work from home in a bedroom office, for instance.\n\nAs we go on, I'll talk about things that require more funds or work to do, but they're quite fulfilling to get done, and make for a much better home both for yourself (and any family that lives with you or may inherit it) or if you ever decide to sell.\n\nSomething you may not often think of is cabinet accessibility in your kitchen. Surprisingly, it can make a big impact with something so seemingly insignificant, like putting a lazy susan mechanism in your corner cabinets. It makes it a lot easier to get things out since you don't have to strain yourself reaching to the back and over other things stored in them. Other kitchen improvements include updating your appliances. I know it isn't the most compelling option, but it can make a huge difference to have something more modern with better ease of use, and it looks prettier, too! Some people prefer to settle for what's usable though, and that's okay; just remember to pick what most suits your needs.\n\nIf you've got a lot of unused space in your lot, there are plenty of things you can do with it. One that can have a surprising impact on the overall quality of the home is tastefully populating your yard with plants such as trees and bushes.  The trees can provide shade, privacy, and places for things like swings or feeders for local birds, and bushes can be super pretty ways of accentuating spaces in your yard. One that's more complicated, but can massively increase the value of your property is adding an addition to your house. It's a great way of adding new functions and square footage, as you can have one or more extra rooms to dedicate to activities or living. Even though it requires a lot of time and work, it's very rewarding with the increase in value and use of your home: I wouldn't recommend it to newcomers, but it's a great longer-term project for experienced home improvers!\n\nThanks for reading along. I hope these suggestions have given you ideas about how you can tailor your home to fit your needs, especially if these led you to your own creative ideas! I look forward to seeing home improvement being more commonplace, especially since it's such a fulfilling thing to do. Stay creative!", "role": "assistant"}], "category": "Rewrite"}

She was the only fairy who didn't have wings, and no one knew why. Furthermore, Adalina was the daughter of the Great Fairy Queen, making her a princess. Adalina was as petite as a flower. However, life didn't treat her delicately. Throughout her life, she constantly faced problems. She couldn't fly and she had barely any magical powers. This is because fairy power comes from the wings. \n\nTherefore, Adalina had to depend on others for help. She was extremely grateful for the help she would receive. She made sure that she always smiled and thanked people. Adalina was loved by the forest creatures due to her affectionate nature. \n\nWhen the time came for her to be Queen, many people doubted her abilities since they did not deem her as powerful. The people protested and argued against it, and Adalina felt as though she had to take a test in an attempt to exhibit the miracles she could spawn. \n\nThis worried the fairy because she knew she did not have the powers expected of her. She can not even travel far distances with her small legs. Adaline sat on a stone near the river and attempted to think of a solution that would leave the fairies astonished. Eventually, the amiable forest animal heard the news of the test that Adalina would have to take. Shortly after, hundreds of the creatures came by her side, prepared to help for as long as necessary.\n\n\"Thank you, friends.

Unfortunately, I don't have the magic required or the wings to keep the dewdrop in.\"\n\"You must have your magic kept elsewhere then! Look!\" an old tortoise eagerly shouted, as it flew through the air, leaving a trail of green behind it.\n\nThe old tortoise was right.

It seems the German government, still haunted by the ghosts of the tragic 1972 Munich Olympics, has entrusted the monumental task of unraveling the events of yesteryears to a group of esteemed historians. In the spring month of April, the German Interior Ministry carefully selected an assembly of eight learned minds, mostly hailing from Israel or the Fatherland, in response to an agreement with kin of the unfortunate Israeli athletes. Lives were lost to the ruthless hands of Palestinian militants, a wound that remains open to this day.\n\nToday, under the stoic gaze of the Interior Ministry's stone walls, they held their maiden meeting. Nancy Faeser, a woman of high authority and Minister of Interior, was solemn in her pledge that the dark clouds shrouding the events of the horrendous attack would finally part to let in the light of transparency. \"The answers which we owe to the victims' family members and the public shall finally be given, answers that have been entombed for more than 50 years,\" she declared with firm resolve. The Ministry's plan was clear: regular publications and scholarly events to slowly but steadily lift the veil of mystery. As I recollect, the German President, one Frank-Walter Steinmeier, offered his public apologies for the German shortcomings, extending his remorse to the Israeli nation and the relatives of the fallen athletes. This was during a ceremony in September, marking half a century since the dark incident unfolded. In an attempt to ameliorate the situation, the German state proposed a settlement of 28 million euros for the bereaved, a part of which had been disbursed prior. An admission of previous authorities' inadequacies was made, as well as the promise of a deep-dive review.\n\nThe shadows of that grim day on Sept. 5, 1972, remain in the annals of history. Eight members of the notorious group Black September breached the Olympic village's paltry defenses. The Israeli team's quarters became the setting for a macabre scene, with the wrestling coach Moshe Weinberg and weightlifter Yossi Romano losing their lives in the ensuing struggle. As the harsh narrative of the past unfolds, it's clear some Israeli athletes made a successful escape, while others weren't as fortunate.

It is alarming and unnerving,\u201d said GOP Rep. Andrew Murr, chair of the General Investigating Committee, during his closing statement following hours of debate. The committee recommended 20 counts of impeachment against Paxton.\n\nDemocrat Rep. Harold Dutton was one of the members voting present. He said the impeachment vote had been rushed. \u201cThe process by which we\u2019re getting this done seems to be abbreviated to the point that it just encroaches on due process,\u201d said Dutton.\n\nPaxton denied wrongdoing in a Friday news conference, but focused his statements against the impeachment this week on his record as a key opponent of President Joe Biden. Paxton\u2019s office has filed dozens of lawsuits against the Biden administration.\n\nThe now-suspended attorney general called the impeachment a \u201cpolitically motivated sham\u201d in a statement just minutes after the vote.\n\n\u201cThe ugly spectacle in the Texas House today confirmed the outrageous impeachment plot against me was never meant to be fair or just,\u201d he said.\n\nPaxton said he was never given a chance to present evidence refuting the findings of an investigation that he abused his office. He has cast House Speaker Dade Phelan, a Republican who presides over a chamber where his party currently holds 85 seats to Democrats\u2019 64, as a \u201cliberal.\u201d He continued his attack on Phelan saying, \u201cPhelan\u2019s coalition of Democrats and liberal Republicans is now in lockstep with the Biden Administration, the abortion industry, anti-gun zealots, and woke corporations.\u201d\n\nThe Office of the Attorney General issued its own \u201ccomprehensive report\u201d about the allegations following the impeachment vote, saying it \u201cunequivocally refutes incorrect testimony\u201d against Paxton. The office also released a report it commissioned from an outside law firm, although the report from Lewis Brisbois Bisgaard and Smith LLP notes it is based only on information and testimony provided by the attorney general\u2019s office.\n\nRepublican Governor Greg Abbott can appoint a provisional replacement while Paxton is temporarily suspended. Paxton would be reinstated if he is acquitted at his Senate trial.\n\nThe impeachment vote had its origins in an investigation launched in March by the General Investigating Committee of the Texas House after Paxton had asked the legislature to approve $3.3 million in government funds to settle a lawsuit with four whistleblowers who were fired from his office.\n\nThat investigation led the committee \u2013 a five-member panel investigating corruption in state government \u2013 to approve 20 articles of impeachment Thursday, setting up the vote in the full House.\n\nDuring the debate Saturday, Rep. Charlie Geren, who is a Republican, claimed Paxton had threatened fellow House members.\n\n\u201cI would like to point out that several members of this House, while on the floor of this House doing the state\u2019s business, received telephone calls from General Paxton personally threatening them with political consequences in their next election,\u201d Geren said.\n\nOpponents of the impeachment largely declined to address the allegations against him, instead focusing on the investigation leading up to the proceedings. \u201cI don\u2019t think today is about whether there\u2019s guilt or innocence. It\u2019s about the process,\u201d said Rep. Tony Tinderholt.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not here to defend Ken Paxton,\u201d Rep. John T. Smithee stated on the floor. He went on to say, \u201cWhat you\u2019re being asked to do today is to impeach without evidence. It is all rumor. It is all innuendo. It is all speculation.\u201d\n\nPaxton\u2019s impeachment is a stunning rebuke of a Republican official in a state where the GOP controls all levers of state government. Voters in Texas shrugged off the swirling scandals around Paxton last year, handing him a third term in November\u2019s election. Paxton had earlier fought off multiple opponents for the GOP nomination, including Bush family scion George P. Bush, the state land commissioner, whom he easily bested in a runoff.\n\nPaxton has long been a controversial figure who has clashed with Texas legislative leadership. A conservative who has aligned himself with former President Donald Trump, he led a lawsuit in 2020 seeking to overturn Joe Biden\u2019s victory in the presidential election.\n\nHe retains support within the Texas GOP. In a statement Friday, state party chairman Matt Rinaldi blasted Phelan for what he called a \u201csham impeachment.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe voters have supported General Paxton through three elections \u2013 and his popularity has only grown despite millions of dollars spent to try to defeat him. Now the Texas House is trying to overturn the election results,\u201d Rinaldi said, adding that he was looking to the \u201cprincipled leadership\u201d of the Senate to \u201crestore sanity and reason for our state.\u201d\n\nIn Texas, no attorney general has ever been impeached and removed from office.

He has cast House Speaker Dade Phelan, a Republican who presides over a chamber where his party currently holds 85 seats to Democrats\u2019 64, as a \u201cliberal.\u201d He continued his attack on Phelan saying, \u201cPhelan\u2019s coalition of Democrats and liberal Republicans is now in lockstep with the Biden Administration, the abortion industry, anti-gun zealots, and woke corporations.\u201d\n\nThe Office of the Attorney General issued its own \u201ccomprehensive report\u201d about the allegations following the impeachment vote, saying it \u201cunequivocally refutes incorrect testimony\u201d against Paxton. The office also released a report it commissioned from an outside law firm, although the report from Lewis Brisbois Bisgaard and Smith LLP notes it is based only on information and testimony provided by the attorney general\u2019s office.\n\nRepublican Governor Greg Abbott can appoint a provisional replacement while Paxton is temporarily suspended. Paxton would be reinstated if he is acquitted at his Senate trial.\n\nThe impeachment vote had its origins in an investigation launched in March by the General Investigating Committee of the Texas House after Paxton had asked the legislature to approve $3.3 million in government funds to settle a lawsuit with four whistleblowers who were fired from his office.\n\nThat investigation led the committee \u2013 a five-member panel investigating corruption in state government \u2013 to approve 20 articles of impeachment Thursday, setting up the vote in the full House.\n\nDuring the debate Saturday, Rep. Charlie Geren, who is a Republican, claimed Paxton had threatened fellow House members.\n\n\u201cI would like to point out that several members of this House, while on the floor of this House doing the state\u2019s business, received telephone calls from General Paxton personally threatening them with political consequences in their next election,\u201d Geren said.\n\nOpponents of the impeachment largely declined to address the allegations against him, instead focusing on the investigation leading up to the proceedings. \u201cI don\u2019t think today is about whether there\u2019s guilt or innocence. It\u2019s about the process,\u201d said Rep. Tony Tinderholt.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not here to defend Ken Paxton,\u201d Rep. John T. Smithee stated on the floor. He went on to say, \u201cWhat you\u2019re being asked to do today is to impeach without evidence. It is all rumor. It is all innuendo. It is all speculation.\u201d\n\nPaxton\u2019s impeachment is a stunning rebuke of a Republican official in a state where the GOP controls all levers of state government. Voters in Texas shrugged off the swirling scandals around Paxton last year, handing him a third term in November\u2019s election. Paxton had earlier fought off multiple opponents for the GOP nomination, including Bush family scion George P. Bush, the state land commissioner, whom he easily bested in a runoff.\n\nPaxton has long been a controversial figure who has clashed with Texas legislative leadership. A conservative who has aligned himself with former President Donald Trump, he led a lawsuit in 2020 seeking to overturn Joe Biden\u2019s victory in the presidential election.\n\nHe retains support within the Texas GOP. In a statement Friday, state party chairman Matt Rinaldi blasted Phelan for what he called a \u201csham impeachment.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe voters have supported General Paxton through three elections \u2013 and his popularity has only grown despite millions of dollars spent to try to defeat him. Now the Texas House is trying to overturn the election results,\u201d Rinaldi said, adding that he was looking to the \u201cprincipled leadership\u201d of the Senate to \u201crestore sanity and reason for our state.\u201d\n\nIn Texas, no attorney general has ever been impeached and removed from office. The only two elected officials to lose office as a result of impeachment were Gov. James Ferguson in 1917 and District Judge O.P. Carrillo in 1975.\n\nFor Paxton to be removed from office, two-thirds of the Texas Senate\u2019s members who are present will have to vote to convict him. His wife, Angela Paxton, is a state senator representing a Dallas-area district.\n\nIt\u2019s not yet clear when the Senate, where Republicans have a 19-12 majority over Democrats, will conduct its trial.

The vote was 121-23, with two members voting \u201cpresent.\u201d\n\nEven more shocking, this was primarily a case of Texas conservatives investigating one of their own.  Rep. Andrew Murr, chair of the General Investigating Committee, is allegedly a Republican. His committee recommended 20 counts of impeachment against Paxton.\n\nEven Democrat Rep.

As asteroids smash into each other, they produce crumbly debris\u2014meteoroids. The force of the asteroid collision can throw the meteoroid debris\u2014and sometimes the asteroids themselves\u2014out of their regular orbit.

They were found everywhere: mingling with the rocky realms of inner planets, frolicking among the gas giants of outer domains, and even wandering at the kingdom's farthest boundaries, the enigmatic realms known as the Kuiper belt and the Oort cloud.\n\nThese brave adventurers hurtled around the Sun at varying speeds, with the swiftest among them zipping through space at a breathtaking 42 kilometers per second.\n\nTheir birth was a story of cataclysm and creation. Many were born when the asteroids, the boulder-sized subjects of the Sun dwelling between Mars and Jupiter, collided with great force. These collisions, in their chaos and beauty, birthed showers of crumbly debris, our valiant meteoroids. The impact was so strong, it could send the newborns and sometimes even their asteroid parents spinning off their usual path, setting them on a daring voyage towards a planet or moon.\n\nMeanwhile, other meteoroids were the lost children of the comets. As a comet raced towards the Sun, it would shed layers of gas and dust, leaving behind a trail of tiny meteoroids. These siblings of circumstance would stick together, forming a close-knit assembly known as a meteoroid stream.\n\nAnd then there were the few, the proud, the fragments of the Moon and Mars. These splinters were torn away from their parental bodies when an asteroid or another meteoroid crashed into them. This perpetual dance of impact and creation, this 'space weathering', was the order of the cosmos. Meteoroids would collide with these bodies, crafting craters and flinging even more cosmic dust back into the solar kingdom. Most meteoroids, the heroes of our tale, were crafted from silicon and oxygen, with a sprinkling of heavier metals like nickel and iron. While the iron meteoroids were hefty and dense, their stone kin were lighter, yet brittle.\n\nThus is the life and the journey of meteoroids, the minute marvels of our grand solar system.

The group called themselves the Committee of Safety \u2014 six citizens of the Kingdom and seven foreign residents of Hawaii (five Americans, one Scotsman, and one German). Their ultimate goal was annexation to the United States. It would be five years, however, until that goal was achieved.\n\nThe plan to overtake Hawaii\u2019s monarchy had been brewing for decades. It flared up during the reign of Queen Liliuokalani, Kalakaua\u2019s sister who succeeded him as monarch on January 29, 1891, after the king\u2019s death.\n\nIn early 1892, a secret group \u2014 the Annexation Club \u2014 was formed by Lorrin A. Thurston, a leading politician, lawyer, businessman and native-born citizen of the Kingdom. The club\u2019s goal was to be ready to act if the queen carried out their worst fear \u2013 proposing a lenient constitution to replace the restrictive one forced on Kalakaua in 1887. That document, the Bayonet Constitution, had been authored by Thurston and it had severely limited the monarch\u2019s power.\n\nAfter much agitation and maneuvering on both sides of the political fence, on January 14, 1893, the queen informed her Cabinet that she intended to propose a new constitution. The Annexation Club quickly learned of her plans and formed the Committee of Safety from among its members. They were able to gain the support of the US government minister John L. Stevens and Captain G. C. Wiltse of the USS Boston, the fully armed US warship anchored in Honolulu Harbor. The queen\u2019s Cabinet refused to support her and any new constitution she offered.\n\nIn an effort to ease tensions, Liliuokalani issued a proclamation that any changes she would seek to the constitution would be accomplished within the framework of the current one. But it was too late to turn back the rising tide of the businessmen who saw their opportunity to finally do away with the monarchy. On January 16, 162 US sailors and marines were landed. The next day, the Committee of Safety issued their proclamation declaring martial law, deposing the queen, and establishing the Provisional Government until such time as union with the US could be attained. At the urging of her Cabinet, the queen surrendered her power to the US government and departed the Palace for her private home nearby. By midnight, almost all of the 17 foreign consuls in Honolulu had recognized the new government, including Stevens and Japanese Consul-General Saburo Fujii.\n\nThe newly formed government immediately sent envoys to Washington DC to seek a treaty of annexation. Likewise, the Royalist faction sent envoys to plead the queen\u2019s case. In the end, an annexation treaty was sent to Congress, but upon the inauguration of Grover Cleveland as US President in early March, the treaty was quickly withdrawn.\n\nMeanwhile, the Japanese Navy warship HIJM Naniwa, arrived in Honolulu on February 23, 1893, to provide protection for Japanese citizens and express Japanese concern after the overthrow of the monarchy. The cruiser remained in Honolulu until May 11, 1893.\n\nIn December 1893, President Cleveland criticized the involvement of American troops in the coup as a misuse of the power of the United States. Senate hearings followed, but Congress did not act to either restore the monarchy or annex Hawaii.\n\nWith their goal of annexation stalled, the leaders of the Provisional Government decided to form themselves into the Republic of Hawaii. On July 2, 1894, their new constitution was ratified and Sanford B. Dole, who had been president of the Provisional Government, was endorsed as president for a six-year term. Dole, a Hawaiian citizen from a missionary family, was a cousin to James D. Dole, who would arrive in the islands from Boston in 1899 and develop the pineapple industry.\n\nThe constitution of the Republic of Hawaii required voters to swear allegiance to the republic.

My pockets were full of\nstick matches. I had an old flashlight, and since I lived by the\nScout\u2019s motto \u2013 Be Prepared \u2013 I had brought along an\numbrella. Finally, being a serious reader, I had the latest\nMarvel Family comics.\n Horse arrived next, his arms barely managing to hold on\nto a mattress that seemed twice his size. As for food, he had\nfour cans of beans jammed into his pockets.\n Max came last. He was lugging a new knapsack that\ncontained a cast-iron frying pan, a packet of hot dogs, and a\nbox of saltine crackers \u2013 plus two bottles. One bottle was\nmustard, the other, celery soda. He also had a bag of Tootsie\nRolls and a shiny hatchet. \u201cTo build a lean-to,\u201d he explained.\n Max\u2019s prize possession however was an official Scout\ncompass. \u201cIt\u2019s really swell,\u201d he told us, \u201cYou can\u2019t ever get\nlost with it.

They didn\u2019t\ncare.\n On the subway platform, we realized we did not know\nwhich station we were heading for. To find out, we studied\nthe system map, which looked like a noodle factory hit by a\nbomb.

In my dad's army surplus knapsack, I had packed a cozy blanket, a soft pillow, and a paper bag filled with three delicious white-bread peanut butter and jelly sandwiches\u2014a perfect combination for lunch, supper, and Sunday breakfast. My pockets were filled with stick matches, and of course, I carried an old flashlight. Being a firm believer in the Scout's motto, \"Be Prepared,\" I had even brought along an umbrella. And being an avid reader, I made sure to bring the latest edition of the Marvel Family comics.\n\nPhilippa arrived next, struggling to maintain her grip on a mattress that seemed twice her size. As for food, she had ingeniously managed to cram four cans of beans into her pockets.\n\nRachie came last, carrying a brand-new knapsack that contained a sturdy cast-iron frying pan, a packet of hot dogs, a box of saltine crackers, and two bottles\u2014one filled with mustard and the other with celery soda. She also proudly displayed a bag of Tootsie Rolls and a shiny hatchet, explaining that it would come in handy for building a lean-to. However, her most prized possession was an official Scout compass. Excitedly, she shared, \"This compass is absolutely amazing. It never fails to point north, no matter what. I got it at the Scout store.\"\n\n\"I despise that place,\" Philippa grumbled. \"It's all new, nothing authentic.\"\n\n\"But this compass is real,\" Rachie insisted. \"It always points north. Sure, you can find cheaper ones, but they tend to point in all different directions.\"\n\n\"What's so great about the north?\" Philippa questioned.\n\n\"That's always the way to go,\" Rachie declared.\n\n\"Says who?\" I challenged.\n\n\"Mr. Brenkman, you silly. Besides, there's always an arrow on maps pointing the way north.\"\n\n\"But cowgirls live out west,\" I reminded them, although they seemed unfazed by my remark.\n\nOn the subway platform, we suddenly realized that we didn't know which station we were supposed to head to. To figure it out, we studied the system map, which resembled a tangled mess of noodles. The desired destination (north) was at the top of the map, so I hoisted Philippa onto my shoulders for a closer look. It wasn't easy since she stubbornly clung to her mattress and the tin cans in her pockets. In the kindest way possible, I asked her to set the mattress down.\n\nJust as she located the station\u2014168th Street\u2014our train arrived. We hurriedly boarded, but to our horror, Philippa screamed, \"My mattress!\" She had left it behind on the platform. With split-second timing, she and I leaped off just before the doors closed. Unfortunately, Rachie remained on the train, and we helplessly watched her panic-stricken face vanish into the distance. \"Wait at the next station!\" I shouted. \"Don't move!\"\n\nThe next train seemed to take an eternity to arrive. And once it finally did, it took even longer to reach the next stop. There was Rachie, surrounded by crumbs that resembled fake snow in a glass ball. She had been so nervous that she ate all her crackers.\n\n\"Didn't that make you thirsty?\" I asked.\n\n\"I drank my soda,\" Rachie replied.\n\nI noticed streaks on her cheeks, and Philippa observed them too. \"Have you been crying?\" Philippa inquired.\n\n\"Nah,\" Rachie responded. \"There was water dripping from the tunnel roof. But you said not to move, right? Well, I was just being obedient.\"\n\nBy the time we boarded the next train, lugging all our belongings, we had been traveling for an hour, yet we had only managed to cover one stop. As we rode, my stomach growled, signaling hunger. I reached into my bag and pulled out one of my sandwiches. The jelly had soaked through the bread, giving it a rather unappetizing appearance, resembling a limp scab.\n\nPhilippa, feeling envious, complained that she was also getting hungry. \"Why don't you eat some of your canned beans?\" I suggested.\n\nShe fumbled and managed to retrieve one can without tearing her pocket too badly. However, a mournful expression appeared on her face.\n\n\"What's the matter?\" I asked curiously.\n\n\"I forgot to bring a can opener,\" Philippa admitted, disappointment evident in her voice.\n\nRachie chimed in, \"You know, in the old days, people used to open cans with their teeth.\"\n\n\"Are you suggesting that I don't know history?\" Philippa retorted defensively.\n\nAlways one to be kind, I handed Philippa half of my sandwich. She gratefully accepted it and squished it into her mouth, silencing her hunger for the next fifteen minutes. It proved something I had always believed: the best way to quell arguments is to offer people peanut butter sandwiches. They simply can't argue with their mouths full.\n\nLost in the captivating world of the Marvel Family comics, we became so engrossed that we missed our intended station. We had to backtrack and take the train in the opposite direction to finally reach our destination. When we emerged onto the street level, the sky had turned dark, casting an eerie atmosphere around us.", "role": "assistant"}], "category": "Rewrite"}

The rabies virus is transmitted by an infected animal biting another animal because that is the way the virus evolved. The number of people bitten by rabid animals and the number of people dying from rabies has dramatically declined over the past 30 years. However, scientists are concerned that the rabies virus could, through natural mutation or genetically engineered mutation, change into a virus that would turn infected people into \"zombies\". Wild animals, such as foxes, skunks, raccoons and vampire bats usually transmit rabies in about a ten-mile area. Unfortunately, there are no natural barriers, such as forests or rivers, to keep infected animals from entering our crowded cities. It would be easy for a wild animal carrying the mutated rabies virus to bite a person and kick off a zombie apocalypse. Like any rabid animals, infected people would bite and infect those around them, thus creating a race of zombies.

It was reported that 4000 people and more than 100 journalists turned out for the much-hyped event.[44] The escape attempt dragged on for over an hour, during which Houdini emerged from his \"ghost house\" (a small screen used to conceal the method of his escape) several times.

The Mirror representative, Frank Parker, refused, saying Houdini could gain an advantage if he saw how the cuffs were unlocked.

Many thought that in her mouth was the key to unlock the special handcuffs. However, it has since been suggested that Bess did not in fact enter the stage at all, and that this theory is unlikely due to the size of the six-inch key.[45] Houdini then went back behind the curtain.

Or maybe you've heard it called manifesting. Or \"The Secret.\" In any case, it's the idea that so long as you believe that you attract luck, the odds will be ever in your favor.\nHere's one example, which went viral on TIkTok: Two friends wanted certain rooms in their apartment \u2014 but they didn't want to ask their other roommates for the rooms. And they knew that things don't always work out in their favor. So they decided to start manifesting the concept that \"everything works out for us.\" Turns out, the other roommates offered the two friends the rooms they wanted. Moral of the story: Think positive.\nBut not everyone can just make their own luck...can they?\nWell, it might not be all about luck.

Sometimes systemic biases can create or block opportunities for some people. Something to be mindful of when you\u2019re thinking of testing this trend out.\ntheSkimm\nLooking on the bright side and believing that things will work out for you can have a positive impact on your mental health.

Or maybe you've heard it called manifesting. Or \"The Secret.\" In any case, it's the idea that so long as you believe that you attract luck, the odds will be ever in your favor.\nHere's one example, which went viral on TIkTok: Two friends wanted certain rooms in their apartment \u2014 but they didn't want to ask their other roommates for the rooms. And they knew that things don't always work out in their favor. So they decided to start manifesting the concept that \"everything works out for us.\" Turns out, the other roommates offered the two friends the rooms they wanted. Moral of the story: Think positive.\nBut not everyone can just make their own luck...can they?\nWell, it might not be all about luck. A quick review of your FYP might confirm that all the \u2018lucky girls\u2019 fit perfectly into society\u2019s beauty standards. Most of the TikTokers gushing over Lucky Girl Syndrome are white, thin, and conventionally attractive. Coincidence? Probably not. Sometimes systemic biases can create or block opportunities for some people. Something to be mindful of when you\u2019re thinking of testing this trend out.\ntheSkimm\nLooking on the bright side and believing that things will work out for you can have a positive impact on your mental health. But as the saying goes, \"Luck is what happens when preparation meets opportunity.\" So don't be hard on yourself in unlucky moments \u2014 and know it can be a much deeper issue than plain old bad luck.\n\n\n", "role": "user"}, {"content": "Verily, There Exists A Trend Known As \"Lucky Girl Syndrome\" That Doth Find Favour Amongst The Denizens Of Tiktok, Belonging To The Esteemed Generation Z. Rooted In The Conviction That A Positive Mindset And An Unwavering Faith In The Fruition Of Good Fortune Can Shape One's Destiny, This Notion Doth Bear Semblance To The Law Of Assumption Or The Art Of Manifesting. Through This Phenomenon, Individuals Do Share Their Anecdotes, Wherein They Claim To Have Reaped Favourable Outcomes By Adopting Such A Mindset.\n\nAlas, It Must Be Duly Noted That The Allure Of Lucky Girl Syndrome May Not Ensnare All Souls. 'Tis Prudent To Consider The Presence Of Systemic Biases And The Standards Of Beauty And Privilege That Society Hath Imposed, Which May Prove Instrumental In Creating Or Impeding Opportunities. Many Proponents Of Lucky Girl Syndrome On Tiktok Do Conform To The Ideals Of Beauty Established By Society, Hence Indicating That Their Experiences May Be Influenced By Factors Surpassing Mere Fortune.\n\nWhilst Maintaining A Positive Disposition Doth Tend To Nurture One's Mental Well-Being, It Behooves Us To Acknowledge That Serendipity Alone May Not Wield The Omnipotent Scepter Of Success. Preparation, Seizing Opportune Moments, And Delving Into Deeper Afflictions Ought To Be Taken Into Account.

And Taylor missed this more than any of us. \n\nTaylor Swift keeps building the legend of her Eras Tour, week after week, city by city, making every night so much longer, wilder, louder, more jubilant than it has to be. There\u2019s nothing in history to compare. This is her best tour ever, by an absurd margin. It\u2019s a journey through her past, starring all the different Taylors she\u2019s ever been, which means all the Taylors that you\u2019ve ever been. Taylor always designs every tour to be the best night of your life. But she designed this one to be the best night of all your lives. Every Era you\u2019ve ever lived through, it\u2019s in here. She does 46 songs, plus snippets of a few more. That means this show has 22 percent of her songbook, and don\u2019t even imagine she didn\u2019t plan it that way.\n\nThis weekend I spent three consecutive nights at these shows, singing and weeping and suffering and agonizing through an emotional epic Tay-pocalypse every night. But it feels brutal that it\u2019s over so soon. Nobody wanted it to stop. Not even Taylor, who paused on Sunday night at her piano during \u201cChampagne Problems\u201d to rave, \u201cIf you think I\u2019m just coasting along thinking this is normal, I can assure you this is not the case. This is extraordinary.\u201d", "role": "user"}, {"content": "Last Friday night in Jersey Taylor Swift yelled, \"Welcome to the Eras Tour!\" She went on to say \u201cThere is one thing that I daydream about with the childlike enthusiasm of a hundred birthday parties, and that is MetLife Stadium Night 1.\u201d Taylor Swift Went on to perform for a total of 83,000 extremely excited fans.

To my delight, I spied a house with an open door. I could hear the sound of the television blaring out from the lounge and as I peered through the window, I saw a couple relaxing in front of Britain's Got Talent. They seemed very preoccupied, so I decided to take a closer look and go inside.\n\nI padded into the house, through the open door and made my way upstairs. There, I saw two babies sleeping soundly in a cot. They looked about nine months old. I was curious about these human children and decided to take a closer inspection. However, I accidentally clawed one of the babies on its arms and face, and the baby started to bleed heavily. There was blood everywhere, but I certainly didn't mean to harm the human child. I think the baby was startled by my presence and she began to make a hideous wailing noise. Before I could make my escape, I heard footsteps coming up the stairs and felt an adult human presence entering the room. Then, a glaring light lit up everything and I was so shocked, I just froze. I stared in horror at the lady who was in front of me. I looked her right in the eye and she glared back at me. \n\nThen, I fled back down the stairs, leaping and bounding two at a time, until I was in the garden, and I sheltered behind a thick hedge. From my vantage point, I heard a terrible commotion coming from the upstairs bedroom. A female voice shrieked and yelled. I heard the sound of a loud siren and an ambulance appeared. Two men jumped out hurriedly and raced inside, in an emergency. After a few minutes, the men reappeared, grasping a baby, followed by a sobbing woman and they all drove off in the ambulance. There had been such an uproar that many people had come out of their houses to see what was happening. A man was shouting that a vicious fox had attacked and seriously injured his baby. I thought that was an extremely unfair accusation, and untrue. I am not a vicious fox. I would never attack an innocent child. What happened was an accident. Sometimes, I forget how sharp my claws are.\n\nHowever, I noticed from that time on, that all doors and windows in the neighbourhood were firmly closed. There was no opportunity to enter these homes. Moreover, humans began to behave uncharacteristically and cruelly. Sadly, a tragedy happened and one of my friends was murdered. He was caught in a trap left out by one of these humans. From that time on, it was a war between foxes and humans. ", "role": "assistant"}], "category": "Rewrite"}

Well, me and the rest of the people in this slice of suburbia. To me, the way his engine barreled through the dirt roads sounded less like a disturbance and more like a promise of something better. And if there was one thing I knew, it was that I was getting out of this place.\n\nAnd maybe he was too young, or foolish, or naive- but when I came up to him and laid my cards out on the table he was far too eager to take the bet. What I asked of him was crazy, and I remember preparing myself for the worst, but he just smiled and nodded his head.

It was easy enough to get a job at the convenience store not long after that, and I remember working every shift I could, meticulously saving every cent in a shoebox under my bed. And each bill or copper round that made its way from my fingers into the pile was another milestone closer to where I wanted to go: anywhere.\n\nIt's funny, but I can't quite remember the moment that boy and I became something more. If I had to guess, I would think it was one of the nights we spent together on the hood of that infamous car, driven out into the fields just shy of the border into the city. We talked about the jobs we'd find and the lives we'd soon make for ourselves-\n\nOr I'd talk about the one I was leaving behind. I'd walk in through the doors of my home only to be greeted by the smell of liquor- either on the breath of my father, whose stomach I'd stare at for proof of life, or worked in deep through the threads of our carpet. My mother, who I used to hate (and I still do, but maybe it's because of jealousy now), left him the second he proved he was heading nowhere, leaving me in the aftermath.\n\nWhen we finally left, my soul was featherweight.\n\nThe boy was flashing white teeth at me from the driver's seat, a denim-clad arm working its way from his side and around my shoulder. I don't remember anything playing on the radio, I just remember the way my heart leaped when I read the welcome sign into the nearest city, and concrete-wrapped buildings shot out of the dirt I had grown so tired of. I think back to laying my cards out on the table and to the sound of this boy's engine cutting through the silence at 2 AM and cannot fathom how I was able to bring this fantasy to life-\n\nBut the adrenaline wore off about two weeks into our stay at the shelter.\n\nI was back to saving pennies, this time in a duffel bag, and this time working as a checkout girl at the market. It was sobering, seeing the boy come back to me each night looking more defeated than when he left that morning. Some days he smelt like my dad, and just like I did with my dad when I was a kid, I would pretend that he didn't.\n\nIt was after the birth of our first son that I realized I was not a martyr. And after our second, I no longer cried to the empty side of our bed that I bought, underneath the roof of a home that was paid for in duffel bag dollar bills. The only thing in this home that was not my own,\n\nsat idly in the garage when it was not in the parking lot of our local dive bar.\n\nIt was 2 AM when I told him, pressing his keys into the palm of his calloused hand, to make a choice:\n\n\u201cLeave tonight or live and die this way.\u201d", "role": "assistant"}], "category": "Rewrite"}

Decomposition takes hundreds of years, our current recycling methods use too much energy, and too often, a lot of waste is produced.\nWe have recently discovered an enzyme capable of \"digesting\" plast, similar to how humans digest food. Using this product, we can significantly reduce the energy used and use the byproducts to create equal-quality plastics.\nThis enzymatic approach has the promise to revolutionize the plastic industry and address the ecological challenges we face. Through this method, we can reduce plastic waste's impact on our planet and its inhabitants. With this method, we are closer to minimizing waste and creating a sustainable future.

{"prompt": "Turn the facts of this article into a series of questions with answers.\n\nOn February 19, 1942\u2014two months after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor\u2014President Franklin Delano Roosevelt signed an executive order establishing the forced imprisonment, or internment, of Japanese Americans. This was upsetting news to First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt, who, less than two weeks after the Pearl Harbor bombing, had urged non-Japanse Americans not to turn against Japanese Americans in her syndicated column, \u201cMy Day.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe, as citizens, if we hear anything suspicious, will report it to the proper authorities,\u201d she wrote in her December 16 column, acknowledging that the United States was at war with Japan, Germany and Italy. \u201cBut the great mass of our people, stemming from these various national ties, must not feel that they have suddenly ceased to be Americans.\u201d\n\nAs first lady, Eleanor Roosevelt could not and did not want to publicly disagree with her husband\u2019s executive order. (Despite their disagreements, she was a fierce protector of FDR\u2019s image and legacy.) Instead, she attempted to assist Japanese Americans who were in the camps, while publicly praising their loyalty and work ethic in order to convince other Americans that they were not a threat.\n\nBy the fall of 1941, Eleanor Roosevelt knew that U.S.the United States entry into World War II was a possibility. And she worried about what that would mean for Japanese Americans. At the time, the United States still barred first-generation Japanese immigrants, known as Issei, from becoming citizens under the 1790 Naturalization Act. Second-generation Japanese Americans, known as Nisei, held U.S. citizenship because they were born in the United States. But this did not protect them from racism and discrimination.\n\nThe first lady reached out to the Justice Department about what might happen to Japanese Americans in the event of war, writes Greg Robinson, a history professor at the University of Quebec in Montreal, in By Order of the President: FDR and the Internment of Japanese Americans. On December 4, 1941\u2014three days before the Pearl Harbor attack\u2014the first lady publicly stated that if the country entered the war, the government would not discriminate against any law-abiding noncitizens living in the United States.\n\nThat proved very quickly to be untrue. After the U.S. declared war on Japan on December 8, the Treasury Department froze all assets of Issei residents. Eleanor intervened to convince the Treasury Department to relax the restrictions so that families could withdraw $100 a month. Over the next few months, prominent white Americans in the government and media began calling for something even more drastic: the \u201cmass evacuation\u201d of citizens and noncitizens of Japanese descent.\n\nThe first lady was not immune to the anti-Japanese misinformation circulating among white Americans at the time. By January 1942, she believed incorrectly that the government had revealed some Japanese Americans to be spies. (In reality, the government never identified any ethnically Japanese spies living in the United States during the war.) Even so, she opposed the idea of mass evacuation.\n\nOne of her allies within FDR\u2019s administration was Attorney General Francis Biddle, who tried to advise the president against mass evacuation. But when it became clear that FDR was going to issue an executive order authorizing the forced removal and internment of Japanese Americans, Biddle declined to have the Justice Department intervene.\n\nUnder Executive Order 9066, the United States forced more than 100,000 Japanese Americans out of their homes and into remote military internment camps. Each camp was surrounded by barbed wire and guard towers. When internees protested the unsafe conditions and inadequate food rations, military police often responded with violence.\n\nPublicly, Eleanor did not criticize this internment. Privately, she began corresponding with Japanese Americans in the camps. And she began advocating for a program to transfer Nisei students out of the camps so they could go to college. Her efforts led to the formation of the National Japanese American Student Relocation Council in May 1942. That year, she also asked the Department of War if she could visit one of the camps. They denied her request.\n\nWhen she asked again if she could visit a camp in early 1943, government officials were more amenable. By then, the Army had \u201copened up enlistment to Japanese American male volunteers, and Franklin Roosevelt endorsed their loyalty,\u201d says Robinson in an interview with HISTORY.com. \u201cHe gave a public statement saying Americanism is a matter of the mind and the heart, and not of ancestry.\u201d\n\nIn April 1943\u2014not long after Eleanor learned that the U.S. hadn\u2019t actually discovered any Japanese Americans spies, as she had previously believed\u2014the first lady made an approved public visit to the Gila River Relocation Center in Pinal County, Arizona. In her \u201cMy Day\u201d column about the visit, she praised the internees as hard-working, law-abiding and loyal to the United States. In an interview with the Los Angeles Times published that month, she said that \u201cthe sooner we get the young Japanese out of the camps, the better.\u201d\n", "prompt_id": "a18975099ec91e15c8fa7c087365da9adeb79da2bbac415be017eba1b1d01294", "messages": [{"content": "Turn the facts of this article into a series of questions with answers.\n\nOn February 19, 1942\u2014two months after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor\u2014President Franklin Delano Roosevelt signed an executive order establishing the forced imprisonment, or internment, of Japanese Americans.

I don't want to say what that is exactly, and I also don't want to say where these indications come from.\n\n\"The only thing that I would clarify is that it doesn't come from the suspect - so we don't have a confession or anything similar now, or an indication from the suspect of where it would make sense to search.\"\n\nMr. Wolters is treating Brueckner as the main suspect in Madeleine's case, although he has never been charged over Madeleine's disappearance and has denied any involvement.\n\nMadeleine disappeared from a holiday apartment in the [REDACTED] resort of [REDACTED] on 3 May 2007, nine days before her fourth birthday.\n\nHers has become one of the most infamous missing person cases in modern times, attracting attention in countries across Europe, America, and Australia.\n\nNews crews from around the world remain stationed around the [REDACTED] reservoir, where they are reporting the latest developments.\n\nBrueckner was living near the [REDACTED] resort when the McCann family was on holiday, and he spent time in the area between 2000 and 2017.\n\nHe is currently in prison in Germany for the rape of a 72-year-old woman in 2005 in the same area where Madeleine went missing.", "role": "assistant"}], "category": "Rewrite"}

The Lakeview was an extravagant establishment, known for its refined atmosphere and exquisite cuisine. As flies buzzing around the dining room, we couldn't help but marvel at the grandeur of the place. The headwaiter, dressed in tails, gracefully guided us to our designated spot. Soft candlelight and the delicate melodies of a harpist filled the air, creating an ambiance of sophistication.\n\nOur presence in the restaurant was motivated by the recent success of our fly family. Our father had just been promoted in the world of insect business. He had excelled in his role, and his superiors recognized his talents, leading to a prestigious promotion and increased status among our fellow flies.\n\nUsually, our fly family frequented garbage bins and feasted on discarded leftovers. But this was a special occasion, and our father wanted to celebrate in style. He asked his fellow flies for recommendations on an elegant restaurant, and the Lakeview was unanimously suggested. So there we were, entering the Lakeview, attempting to navigate the vast dining room with our tiny wings.\n\nWe settled down at our table, and the oversized menus were placed before us. Flipping through the elaborate pages, we realized that most of the descriptions were in a language foreign to us. Our fly parents, ever resourceful, had brought along a pocket-sized dictionary. They huddled over it, buzzing with excitement as they attempted to decipher the French terms.\n\n\"Pat\u00e9 en croute,\" our father buzzed, consulting the dictionary. \"Pat\u00e9 is paste... croute is crust... Ah, a paste in crust!\"\n\nIn the end, father surrendered to the complexities of the menu. \"Why don't we simply choose four random dishes?\" he proposed.\n\nMother, ever the cautious one, expressed her concerns. \"Are you sure that's wise? I've heard that flies have peculiar dietary preferences in different regions.\"\n\nBut father was determined. \"A fly can feast on anything, regardless of its origin,\" he confidently proclaimed.\n\nSoon enough, bowls of soup were placed before us. As flies, we were adept at sipping liquid food, but these shallow plates presented a new challenge. We buzzed around, observing the techniques of the other diners. The dim lighting made it difficult to discern their actions, but we managed to learn a trick or two.\n\nOur parents, having researched Western etiquette, guided us. \"Tilt your plate,\" they whispered, their wings fluttering with excitement. \"It makes the soup more accessible.\"\n\nAnd so, we tilted our plates, dipping our tiny fly mouths into the liquid sustenance. The slurping sounds filled the air, echoing like miniature gusts of wind.\n\nA brief pause in the harpist's melodies allowed our symphony of slurps to resonate throughout the restaurant. It was as if the buzzing of flies had taken center stage, captivating the attention of all present. The nearby diners, including humans, stared in awe and disbelief, their eyes widening at the peculiar sight and sound.\n\nAmidst the commotion, one unfortunate fly accidentally bumped into a waiter pouring wine at a nearby table. The bottle tipped over, spilling crimson liquid onto the tablecloth and dripping onto an unsuspecting diner's lap. The mishap went unnoticed for a moment, as all eyes were fixed upon our fly family's performance.\n\nUnable to bear the intensity of the attention, I fluttered away discreetly, seeking solace in the nearby restroom. Splashing cold water on my tiny face, I reflected upon my peculiar situation. Here I was, a fly in a lavishly decorated restroom, surrounded by pink and silver wallpaper, marbled sinks, and a sense of otherworldly elegance. I couldn't help but question our place in this human-centric world, pondering the meaning of our presence in the Lakeview restaurant.\n\nThe door swung open, and my mother flew in, her compound eyes scanning the room. \"Are you in there? Are you unwell?\" she buzzed with genuine concern.\n\nRealizing that I couldn't abandon our family just because of a peculiar dining experience, I replied, undoing the latch, \"I'm alright.\"\n\nMother didn't delve into the details of the rest of the dinner, and I didn't press for them. In the following weeks, I managed to push the memory of that surreal evening to the depths of my mind, only to have it resurface a few times each day.

He could make a sad person laugh and a happy person cry. He was so skilled at manipulating people's emotions, he could control their feelings at will. \n\nEveryone loved him, young and old, male and female. People would think about him all the time or do whatever he asked. He didn't even have to ask; people would do things for him because they wanted to please him.\n\nMany people got pictures of him to look at, filling their minds with images of him as if he belonged to them. It was like when people imagine owning big houses and fancy cars they've seen. They put more energy into this thought than they put into the work to earn them.\n\nSo many people who never even touched him fantasized that they were the love of his life. As for me, who used to be free, I fell for his charm when I was young and gave him all my love.\n\nBut unlike some others, I didn't ask for his attention or give in to him when he asked for mine. I knew I had to protect my honor, so I kept my distance. I had seen enough to know what he was like. His charm was just a mask for his true intentions.\n\nBut who can avoid trouble just by knowing about it in advance? Who can learn from others' mistakes when our hearts tell us to do otherwise? When we're in love, advice often falls on deaf ears. We don't want to listen to others; we want to experience things for ourselves.\n\nIt's not easy to resist the things that seem so good, just because others warn us about potential harm. We all have desires that can make us ignore our better judgment. Even when we know it's wrong, we still want to taste the forbidden fruit.\n\nI could have told myself that he was a liar. I knew all about his deceitful ways. I had heard about his other relationships and saw how he tricked people using his charm. I knew that his promises were empty and his loving words were just an act.\n\nI resisted him for a long time until one day he begged me, \"Please, take pity on me. Don't be afraid of my love. I promise you, I've never said this to anyone before. I've been invited to love many, but I've never loved or wooed anyone.\"\n\nHe went on, \"All the wrongs you see me do are mistakes of passion, not of my heart. They're not caused by love. Those involved weren't true or kind. They disgraced themselves, and I feel less ashamed by how much their blame includes me. \u201c\n\n\"Of all the people I've seen, none have warmed my heart or charmed me as you have. I may have hurt others, but I've never been hurt. I've kept others' hearts under my control, but my heart was always free and independent.\u201d\n\n\"Look at these gifts of love sent to me - pearls and rubies red as blood. They represent their love and embarrassment. There are also locks of their hair tied with metal, which I accepted graciously along with their tears. They sent me precious gems and deeply emotional poems, each adding to the beauty and the worth of the gifts. \u201c\n\nThere was a diamond - beautiful and strong. A green emerald that could make the weak-sighted feel better. A blue sapphire and an opal that could blend with anything. Each gemstone, described so cleverly, either brought a smile or evoked sadness.\n\n\"All these tokens of passionate love, tender desires and thoughtfulness, Nature has told me not to keep but to give back where I must - to you.

Also, they don\u2019t have eyelids, which prevents them from closing their eyes. So, even when they are sleeping, their eyes remain open. So, if you have a pet goldfish, we\u2019d recommend switching off the light in the water body to ensure they get good sleep.\n\n4.

As a result, over 200 different types of goldfish species are available.\n\n5. Like humans, goldfish taste their food before they gobble things down. So, when you offer them food inside the aquarium, you will often find them nibbling on the food before they wipe it out. And a unique fact about goldfish is that they taste with their lips and not their tongue. The majority of their taste buds are on their lips. Goldfish don\u2019t have a tongue.\n\n6.

Cyborg guards, their cold metal frames accentuated by glowing red eyes, patrolled the compound with unwavering vigilance. They were a menacing presence, a stark reminder of the unforgiving nature of this dystopian facility.\n\nAmidst the eerie silence, a mother sternly admonished her two young daughters, drawing their attention to Bella, a girl who stood out as an outcast among them. The girls, their innocent curiosity overcoming any sense of fear, taunted Bella, pelting her with debris as their mother passively observed. The laughter of the children, echoing through the desolate surroundings, mirrored the cruelty that permeated the very essence of the boot camp.\n\nAs the afternoon sun reached its zenith, the prisoners were momentarily unchained and escorted to the park's bathroom.

The sight was disorienting, a stark reminder of the sacrifices she had made in this futuristic hellscape.\n\nIn the midst of this unsettling encounter, two girls of similar age, unbound by imprisonment, entered the bathroom. They preened themselves, tending to their hair and applying makeup, their actions a stark contrast to Bella's constrained existence. The guards, ever vigilant, stood behind Bella, a constant reminder of her captivity. The girls fell silent, their gaze meeting Bella's, and an unspoken understanding passed between them. The laughter that erupted from their lips was laced with derision, reminiscent of the cruel laughter Bella had once indulged in, oblivious to the pain inflicted on others.\n\nAlone with her thoughts, Bella sought solace in the realization that these strangers held no connection to her past life, offering a glimmer of hope that her torment would remain confined within the confines of this futuristic boot camp.

Sundays brought mandatory chapel sessions, while the other days were consumed by schoolwork and addiction therapy. The latter involved laboring through thick workbooks, where the detrimental effects of drugs were expounded upon, and participants were tasked with introspection and listing the individuals they had harmed.\n\nDespite doubting the genuine scrutiny of her notebooks, Bella and her fellow prisoners diligently completed the exercises, aware that any transgressions could amplify their suffering.

{"prompt": "Rewrite these paragraphs from an article about the artist Jean-Michel Basquiat as if you are the journalist interviewing Basquiat about his life and artwork.\n\nIn 1985, the New York Times Magazine featured a shoeless Jean-Michel Basquiat on its cover. Titled \u201cNew Art, New Money,\u201d the piece it ran with was ostensibly about the artist, but its focus was really the vague concept of the \u201cart star\u201d\u2014a celebrity who not only made a lot of money (largely unheard of), but who didn\u2019t care if others knew how much money they made (terribly uncool). Art stars, the article said, went to the Midtown New York hotspot Mr. Chow, a trendy watering hole that doubled as a place to be seen and a place to have a drink. That made Basquiat quite unlike Jackson Pollock and his contemporaries, whose clubhouse, the West Village Cedar Tavern, was described as \u201cgrubby\u201d and anonymous.\n\nOften spotted beside Keith Haring and Andy Warhol, Basquiat would show up to Mr. Chow decked out in an Armani suit. He\u2019d drink kir royale and socialize with the art-world elite. At the time of writing, he was 24. He had gone from selling drawings for $50 in 1980 to selling canvases \u201cat a brisk pace\u2014so brisk, some observers joked, that the paint was barely dry,\u201d the article said. Basquiat said he worried he had become a \u201cgallery mascot.\u201d Not everyone knew what to make of the young Black man and his frenetic, rebellious paintings, but everyone wanted to be associated with him. Everyone still does.\n\nDespite his outsized reputation, Basquiat\u2019s career did not last long\u2014he died at 27 of a heroin overdose in 1988. According to Phoebe Hoban\u2019s book Basquiat: A Quick Killing in Art, the artist left behind \u201c917 drawings, 25 sketchbooks, 85 prints, and 171 paintings.\u201d Nevertheless, that oeuvre has become one of the defining ones of the 20th century.\n\nIn May 2016, one of his \u201cHead\u201d paintings sold for $57.3 million.

Titled \u201cNew Art, New Money,\u201d the piece it ran with was ostensibly about the artist, but its focus was really the vague concept of the \u201cart star\u201d\u2014a celebrity who not only made a lot of money (largely unheard of), but who didn\u2019t care if others knew how much money they made (terribly uncool). Art stars, the article said, went to the Midtown New York hotspot Mr. Chow, a trendy watering hole that doubled as a place to be seen and a place to have a drink. That made Basquiat quite unlike Jackson Pollock and his contemporaries, whose clubhouse, the West Village Cedar Tavern, was described as \u201cgrubby\u201d and anonymous.\n\nOften spotted beside Keith Haring and Andy Warhol, Basquiat would show up to Mr. Chow decked out in an Armani suit. He\u2019d drink kir royale and socialize with the art-world elite. At the time of writing, he was 24. He had gone from selling drawings for $50 in 1980 to selling canvases \u201cat a brisk pace\u2014so brisk, some observers joked, that the paint was barely dry,\u201d the article said. Basquiat said he worried he had become a \u201cgallery mascot.\u201d Not everyone knew what to make of the young Black man and his frenetic, rebellious paintings, but everyone wanted to be associated with him. Everyone still does.\n\nDespite his outsized reputation, Basquiat\u2019s career did not last long\u2014he died at 27 of a heroin overdose in 1988. According to Phoebe Hoban\u2019s book Basquiat: A Quick Killing in Art, the artist left behind \u201c917 drawings, 25 sketchbooks, 85 prints, and 171 paintings.\u201d Nevertheless, that oeuvre has become one of the defining ones of the 20th century.\n\nIn May 2016, one of his \u201cHead\u201d paintings sold for $57.3 million.

These orcas were known for their beautiful black-and-white patterns and their playful nature. But something strange was happening. Over the past three years, these orcas had been causing trouble for boats sailing in their waters. The orcas would approach the boats and occasionally even bite their rudders, making it challenging for the boats to steer. Can you imagine that? Some of the boats were so badly damaged that they were unable to even move! When Alfredo L\u00f3pez was researching these orcas, he discovered that nearly 20% of their attacks rendered the boats unusable.\n\nEach person was confused.  Why were the orcas acting so naughtily? The scientists had two theories. One theory was that the orcas had devised a brand-new sport to engage in with the boats. Just like you know how we create new games from time to time just for fun. These orcas may have followed suit. The alternative theory suggested that perhaps the orcas were acting defensively because they were trying to remember something bad that had happened to them in the past involving a boat.\n\nAnd so, every day, as the sun set and the stars came out, the orcas and the people continued their adventures in the big, beautiful ocean, waiting to unravel the mystery of the playful orcas.

The density of the atmosphere varies seasonally, as winter forces carbon dioxide to freeze out of the Martian air. In the ancient past, the atmosphere was likely significantly thicker and able to support water flowing on the planet's surface. Over time, lighter molecules in the Martian atmosphere escaped under pressure from the solar wind, which affected the atmosphere because Mars does not have a global magnetic field.

She's a colder planet than Earth due to her greater distance from the sun. Her average temperature stays around -80\u00b0F. But things get even more extreme with temperatures reaching -195\u00b0F near the poles during winter. However, during midday near the equator, it can become quite bearable at 70\u00b0F.\n\nDiary Entry 2 - February 15, 2023\nThe Martian atmosphere is rich in CO2 but about 100 times less dense than ours. Interestingly, it's thick enough to support weather, clouds, and winds. Seasonal variations cause carbon dioxide to freeze out of the Martian air during winter. Some say, in the past, the atmosphere was likely denser, capable of supporting flowing water.\n\nDiary Entry 3 - April 5, 2023\nOver time, lighter molecules in the Martian atmosphere have escaped, largely due to pressure from the solar wind. Mars lacks a global magnetic field, so the atmosphere is affected more directly. NASA's MAVEN mission is studying this process currently, uncovering more mysteries of our destination.\n\nDiary Entry 4 - May 20, 2023\nNASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter has found carbon-dioxide snow clouds, making Mars unique in our solar system. Mars' winters are not just chilling but also dust-ridden. Dust storms there are the largest known, capable of blanketing the entire planet and lasting for months. This results from airborne dust absorbing sunlight and causing wind. I hope our equipment can withstand this Martian fury.\n\nDiary Entry 5 - July 10, 2023\nWe have finally arrived at our destination after about seven months. Mars has a longer year compared to Earth due to its farther distance from the sun \u2014 687 days compared to our 365. Days there are nearly identical to ours, with a complete rotation taking about 24 hours and 40 minutes. This will surely help us in maintaining our Earth-based routines.\n\nDiary Entry 6 - August 25, 2023\nMars, like Earth, experiences seasons due to its axial tilt. The difference is, Martian seasons are more extreme. When Mars is closest to the sun, its southern hemisphere gets a short, warm summer, and the northern one gets a short, cold winter. When farthest, it's the other way around. This celestial ballet will be something to behold.\n\nDiary Entry 7 - October 1, 2023\nStill getting used to the environment here. The Martian axis tilt isn't stabilized by a large moon like Earth's. It has led to different climates on Mars throughout its history. A study suggests that the changing tilt might have caused temporary warming periods that allowed water to flow, releasing methane into Mars' atmosphere.\n\nDiary Entry 8 - November 15, 2023\nMars has been the subject of observation since Galileo Galilei used a telescope to study it in 1610. Astronomers later discovered its polar ice caps. Some even mistook geological features for long canals, hinting at a possible civilization. We are, in a way, stepping into the footprints of these early observers.\n\nDiary Entry 9 - December 30, 2023\nLike several Martian rocks have made their way to Earth, our return home will also provide scientists with information for unique study opportunities. Although not like the rock Allan Hills 84001 (ALH84001) that was found in 1996 and believed to contain potential evidence of Mars's life, this expedition still contributes significantly to our understanding.\n\nDiary Entry 10 - February 10, 2024\nReflecting on this mission manned mission, we have certainly come a long way since the robotic exploration of Mars that began in the 1960s. Early missions like Mariner 4 and Mariners 6 and 7 revealed Mars as a barren world. Later, Mariner 9 orbited Mars, mapping about 80% of the planet and discovering its volcanoes and grand canyons.

When other dogs come along and sniff the area, they will know your dog has been there and they will most likely leave their own message by urinating in the same or adjacent spot. This unique form of communication can even tell other dogs if they sense danger or are available sexually. Urine marking sends messages to other dogs about where they\u2019ve been and what they\u2019ve been doing. So when you\u2019re out walking with your dog, be sure to slow down and let them sniff the messages left by other dogs and catch up on the local \u201cnews\u201d.", "role": "user"}, {"content": "OK, I know there are a lot of things out there that I really like.

{"prompt": "Rewrite the article with comedic twist.\n\nMosquitoes bite, suck your blood, and leave you with itchy bumps and possibly a horrible infection. Mosquito-borne pathogens include malaria, West Nile virus, Zika virus, Chikungunya virus, and dengue.\n\nWhile you might fantasize about living in a mosquito-free world, eradicating them would actually be disastrous for the environment. Adult mosquitoes are food for other insects, birds, and bats, while larval mosquitoes support aquatic ecosystems. The best we can hope for is to limit their ability to transmit disease, repel them, and kill them within the confines of our yards and homes.\n\nMosquito-killing products bring in the big bucks, so it should come as no surprise that there is a wealth of misinformation out there. Before you get sucked into buying a product that simply won't work, get educated about what does and does not kill these blood-sucking pests.\n\nFirst, you need to understand the difference between repelling mosquitoes and killing them. Repellents make a location (like your yard or skin) less attractive to mosquitoes, but don't kill them. So, citronella, DEET, smoke, lemon eucalyptus, lavender, and tea tree oil might keep the insects at bay, but won't control them or get rid of them in the long run. Repellents vary in effectiveness, too. For example, while citronella may deter mosquitoes from entering a small, enclosed area, it doesn't really work in a wide open space (like your back yard).\n\nThere are a host of methods that actually do kill mosquitoes, but aren't great solutions. A classic example is a bug zapper, which kills only a few mosquitoes, yet attracts and kills beneficial insects that keep the mozzy population down. Similarly, spraying pesticides is not an ideal solution because mosquitoes can become resistant to them, other animals get poisoned, and the toxins can cause lasting environmental damage.\n\nMany species of mosquitoes required standing water to breed, so one of the most effective methods of controlling them is to remove open containers and repair leaks. Dumping containers of standing water kills the larvae living in them before they get a chance to mature.\n\nHowever, removing water may be undesirable or impractical in some cases. Further, some species don't even need standing water to reproduce! The Aedes species, responsible for transmitting Zika and dengue, lays eggs out of water. These eggs remain viable for months, ready to hatch when sufficient water becomes available.\nA better solution is to introduce predators that eat immature or adult mosquitoes or infectious agents that harm mosquitoes without affecting other wildlife.\n\nMost ornamental fish consume mosquito larvae, including koi and minnows. Lizards, geckos, dragonfly adults and naiads, frogs, bats, spiders, and crustaceans all eat mosquitoes.\n\nAdult mosquitoes are susceptible to infection by the fungi Metarhizium anisoplilae and Beauveria bassiana. A more practical infectious agent is the spores of the soil bacterium Bacillus thurigiensis israelensis (BTI),. Infection with BTI makes the larvae unable to eat, causing them to die. BTI pellets are readily available at home and gardening stores, easy to use (simply add them to standing water), and only affect mosquitoes, black flies, and fungus gnats. The treated water remains safe for pets and wild animals to drink. The disadvantages of BTI are that it requires reapplication every week or two and it doesn't kill adult mosquitos.\nThere are several chemical methods that target mosquitoes without the risks to other animals that come with spraying pesticides.\n\nSome methods rely on chemical attractants to lure mosquitoes to their doom. Mosquitoes are attracted to carbon dioxide, sugary scents, heat, lactic acid, and octenal. Gravid females (those carrying eggs) may be attracted to traps laced with a hormone released during the egg-laying process.\n\nThe lethal ovitrap is dark, water-filled container, typically with a small opening to prevent larger animals from drinking the water. Some traps use chemicals to bait the traps, while others simply provide a convenient breeding ground. The traps may be filled with predators (e.g., fish) or with dilute pesticide to kill larvae (larvicide) and sometimes adults. These traps are highly effective and affordable. The disadvantage is that multiple traps must be used to cover an area (about one every 25 feet).\n\nAnother chemical method is the use of an insect growth regulator (IGR), added to water to inhibit larval development. The most common IGR is methoprene, which is supplied as a time-release brick. While effective, methoprene has been shown to be mildly toxic to other animals. \n\nAdding a layer of oil or kerosene to water kills mosquito larvae and also prevents females from depositing eggs. The layer alters the surface tension of the water. Larvae can't get their breathing tube to the surface for air, so they suffocate. However, this method kills other animals in the water and makes the water unfit for consumption.\nOne example of a physical method of killing mosquitoes is swatting them with your hand, a fly-swatter, or an electric swatter. Swatting works if you've only got a few mosquitoes, but it's not particularly helpful if you're being swarmed. While bug zappers aren't ideal outdoors because they can unnecessarily kill beneficial insects, electrocuting indoor insects isn't generally considered objectionable. Just remember, you need to bait a bug zapper to attract mosquitoes, because they don't care about the pretty blue light.\n\nBecause mosquitoes are not strong fliers, it's also easy to suck them onto a screen or into a separate trap using a fan.

What a delight! We all dream of a world free from these buzzing nuisances, but believe it or not, getting rid of them would be a total disaster for the environment.\n\nYou see, adult mosquitoes are like fast food for other insects, birds, and bats. They're the all-you-can-eat buffet for the insect world! And let's not forget about the larval mosquitoes. They play a crucial role in supporting aquatic ecosystems. So, as much as we despise them, the best we can do is limit their disease-spreading abilities, repel them, and kill them within the comfort of our yards and home.\n\nNow, brace yourself, because mosquito-killing products are a gold mine. And where there's money to be made, there's bound to be a plethora of misinformation. Don't fall victim to the charade of useless products! It's time to get educated on what works against these bloodthirsty critters.\n\nFirst things first, we need to understand the difference between repelling mosquitoes and straight-up obliterating them. Repellants, like citronella, DEET, and all those fancy-sounding oils, make your location [like your yard or your skin] less enticing to mosquitoes. But let's get real here, they won't kill the little buggers or solve the problem in the long run. It's like trying to keep your annoying neighbour at bay with a strongly scented candle. It might work for a while, but eventually, they'll come back, uninvited and ready to ruin your evening.\n\nNow, for methods that claim to kill mosquitoes. Brace yourselves for disappointment because they aren't all that great.  Take big zappers, for example. Sure, they'll fry a few mosquitoes, but they'll also take down some beneficial insects that help keep the mosquito population in check. Oops, collateral damage.\n\nAnd let's not forget about spraying pesticides. Sure, it sounds like a solid plan, but mosquitoes can quickly become resistant to these chemicals, Plus, another innocent creature ends up getting poisoned, and the long-term environmental damage is no joke. So, unless you're aiming to create a mutant army of super mosquitoes, let's skip the pesticide party. \n\nNow, here's a tip that actually works. Many mosquitoes breed in standing water, so removing open containers and fixing leaks is an effective way to control them. It's like hitting the nursery where it hurts! Dumping the water-filled mosquito cribs kills the larvae before they have the chance to mature and ruin your summer nights.\n\nBut it isn't always that simple. Some mosquitoes are so crafty that they don't even need standing water to reproduce. Take the Aedes species, responsible for Zika and dengue, for example. These little troublemakers lay eggs outside of water, just waiting for the perfect opportunity to hatch. They're like spy agents of the mosquito world.\n\nSo, what can we do? Well, how about unleashing the power of nature? Introduce predators that feast on immature or adult mosquitoes. We're talking about lizards, geckos, dragonflies, frogs, bats, spiders, and crustaceans. It's like assembling a superhero team to battle the forces of evil [or in this case, itchy bumps and diseases.\n\nWe can infect those bloodsuckers with fungi, bacteria, and other agents that make them regret ever messing with us. For example, adult mosquitoes can fall victim to fungi like Metarhizium anisoplilae and Beauverua bassiana. Talk about a fungal infection they'll never forget! and if you prefer something more practical, try infecting them with Bacillus thurigiensis israelensis [BTI], a bacterium that ruins their appetite and leads them to demise. It's like serving them a deadly dinner they won't be able to resist.\n\nNow, let's talk about chemical warfare against mosquitoes, minus the risks to other innocent critters. Some clever methods use chemical attractants to lure mosquitos to their demise. It's like setting up a mosquito trap disguised as a five-star restaurant, complete with irresistible delicacies. \n\nAnd have you heard of lethal ovitrap? It's like a mosquito nightclub that no female mosquito can resist. It's a dark, water-filled container with a small opening to keep out party crashers. Some traps use chemicals as bait, while others provide the perfect breeding ground. You can invite predators or add a dash of pesticide to the mix. Talk about throwing wild party mosquitoes will regret attending!\n\nBut wait, there's more! We have the insect growth regulator [IGR], a chemical that ruins the larvae' development. It's like giving them a taste of the \"you shall not grow' potion. However, we must admit, it has a slight downside- it's mildly toxic to other creatures. \nOops!\n\nNow, here's a method that's straight out of a slapstick comedy. Get ready to swat those bloodsuckers with your bare hands, a fly swatter, or an electric swatter. Swatting works like magic when you're dealing with just a few mosquitoes. But if you're facing a full-on mosquito invasion, well good luck with that! It's like trying to fight an army of tiny vampires armed with a rolled-up newspaper. Let's just say the odds aren't in your favour.\n\nOh, and did I mention that mosquitoes aren't the brightest when it comes to flying? That's right! You can easily suck them onto a screen or a trap using a fan. It's like the ultimate mosquito vortex! Those suckers caught in the wind will meet their demise due to dehydration. As for the screen traps, you can create your very own DIY version by attracting window screen fabric to the back of a fan. It's like setting up a mosquito-themed escape room, with no escape in sight.\n\nSo there you have it, folks! The hilarious battle against mosquitoes. Remember, these bloodsuckers may be annoying, but they provide a buffet for other insects and support aquatic ecosystems. Our best bet is to repel them, limit their disease transmission, and maybe unleash a few predators or infect them with a touch of nature's wrath. And if all else fails, well, at least you can enjoy a good laugh while swatting them away with a fly swatter or watching them get trapped in your DIY fan-powered vortex. Good luck, mosquito warriors!\n", "role": "assistant"}], "category": "Rewrite"}

The cocaine stayed in the recipe for 17 years until it was removed in 1903. That's when it became a staple in America. So cool!\n\nCoca-Cola has evolved since then and people found several unusual uses for this acidic drink along the way. This famous soda has a pH of about 2.7 (say what?), so no wonder it got people's creative juices flowing. Can you guess what they came up with?

Pour it along the edges of the toilet bowl and leave it overnight. By the time morning rolls around you'll have a spotless toilet. OMG, this is just amazing!\n\nNow we come to #2: Coca-Cola as a garden fertilizer. You read that right, gardenias, azaleas and grass love Coke just as much as you. Pour it around the base of these plants to give them some extra nutrients and they'll grow like crazy. Yay! So easy. And for your lawn, the CO2 in Coke will help, as well as some other minerals that soda drinks contain which help plants grow.\n\nHere comes #3: Braise your meat with Coca-Cola. Yep, Coca-Cola can be a great help in the kitchen, especially when you bring the BBQ into the game. Make your usual braise and then add Coke to it instead of things like red wine. It's amazing for a pot roast and will add just the right amount of sweetness. It will be to die for! And if you reduce the liquid after you remove the meat you'll get an even more intense flavour.\n\nHere is the last one: #4: Coca-Cola will help you remove rust and loosen bolts. I bet you've had this problem before where you just couldn't unscrew that one stubborn screw and it was driving you bananas. Ugh, so annoying. Well, Coca-Cola can dissolve metal oxides and break up rust with its bubbly goodness. It's a slower process than using normal rust remover, but it's just that much more exciting to tell all your friends that you just used Coke to get that screw loose. Ha!

This theory explains several concepts that are relevant in the observable world: the composition of a pure gold necklace, what makes the pure gold necklace different than a pure silver necklace, and what occurs when pure gold is mixed with pure copper. Before discussing the atomic theory, this article explains the theories that Dalton used as a basis for his theory: the law of conservation of mass and the law of constant composition.\n\nLaw of Conservation of Mass: (1766-1844)\nThe law of conservation of mass states that the total mass present before a chemical reaction is the same as the total mass present after the chemical reaction; in other words, mass is conserved. The law of conservation of mass was formulated by Antoine Lavoisier (1743-1794) as a result of his combustion experiment, in which he observed that the mass of his original substance\u2014a glass vessel, tin, and air\u2014was equal to the mass of the produced substance\u2014the glass vessel, \u201ctin calx\u201d, and the remaining air.\n\nHistorically, this was a difficult concept for scientists to grasp.

Scientists did not take into account the gases that play a critical role in this reaction.\n\nLaw of Constant Composition\nJoseph Proust (1754-1826) formulated the law of constant composition (also called the law of definite proportions). This law states that if a compound is broken down into its constituent elements, the masses of the constituents will always have the same proportions, regardless of the quantity or source of the original substance.

Last month, eager crypto Redditors needed 69.01 karma to get that dollar.\n\nYou\u2019ve been able to convert some things to cash for about a year, but you\u2019ll have to move them from their current location to a new location. It\u2019s not easy. \n\nThat\u2019s because the r/CryptoCurrency tokens are being tested and are designed for use within the subreddit. Redditors are encouraged to use tokens to purchase special memberships to the subreddit. \n\nWith the membership, users can add GIFs to comments, buy special badges and awards, tip other users, and participate in polls to improve the subreddit, where a member\u2019s clout is weighted by the tokens they\u2019ve earned.\n\nThe supply of this is capped at 250 million tokens. In October, the subreddit initially distributed 50 million of these\u2014the high number factored karma earned up to that point. Another 5 million were released the next month, and the distribution reduces by 2.5% each month. \n\nThere are other tokens you can earn through Reddit. Visitors to r/Fortnite, a subreddit dedicated to the Battle Royale game, can earn sub-specific tokens each month with their karma.", "role": "assistant"}], "category": "Rewrite"}

Of all the important cities of Japan, only two, Kyoto and Hiroshima, had not been visited in strength by B-san, or Mr. B, as the Japanese, with a mixture of respect and unhappy familiarity, called the B-29; and Mr. Tanimoto, like all his neighbors and friends, was almost sick with anxiety. He had heard uncomfortably detailed accounts of mass raids on Kure, Iwakuni, Tokuyama, and other nearby towns; he was sure Hiroshima\u2019s turn would come soon. He had slept badly the night before, because there had been several air-raid warnings.

We'll explore the groundbreaking discoveries that shaped our understanding of cells and meet experts who have helped revolutionize this field of biology. So, grab a snack, sit back, and get ready for a mind-blowing episode. \n\n[Background Music]\n\nHost: Our story begins in the year 1665 when a brilliant scientist named Robert Hooke forever changed our perception of the microscopic world. Hooke published a remarkable book called Micrographia, where he meticulously documented the organism he observed using the newly invented microscope. Joining us today is Dr. Sarah Thompson, a renowned expert in cell biology. Dr. Thompson, could you tell us more about Robert Hooke's groundbreaking work?\n\nDr. Thompson: Absolutely, Madeline. Hooke's observations were truly revolutionary. While examining a piece of cork, he noticed small box-shaped structures that reminded him of the tiny rooms in monasteries. These structures, which he called \"cells,\" became the foundation of his discovery. Hooke's incredible observation led to the birth of the classical cell theory.\n\nHost: Fascinating! So, what exactly is the classical cell theory and who proposed it?\n\nDr. Thompson: The classical cell theory was proposed by Theodor Schwann in 1839. It consists of three fundamental parts. The first part states that all organisms are made of cells. The second part emphasizes that cells are the basic unit of life. Schwann and Matthias Schleiden reached these conclusions in 1838, following their extensive observations of plant and animal cells. The third part, known as \"omnis cellula e cellula\" or \"all cells come from cells,\" was described by Rudolf Virchow in 1858.\n\nHost: That's incredible! The classical cell theory laid the groundwork for our understanding of cells. But how has technology advanced since then?\n\nDr. Thompson: Great question, Madeline. Technological advancement has played a pivotal role in our continued exploration of cells. With improved tools and techniques, scientists have made astonishing discoveries, leading to the formulation of the modern cell theory.\n\nHost: And what are the key additions to the modern cell theory?\n\nDr. Thompson: The modern cell theory encompasses three main additions. First, we now know that DNA is passed between cells during cell division, facilitating the transfer of genetic information. Second, cells within species are largely similar structurally an chemically, underscoring the unity of life. And finally, energy flow occurs within cells, which is crucial for their functioning and survival.\n\nHost: Fascinating, Dr. Thompson! These new discoveries have undoubtedly expanded our knowledge of cells. But could you give us a glimpse into how these breakthroughs have influenced other scientific disciplines or even everyday life?\n\nDr. Thompson: Certainly! Our understanding of cells has profound implications across various fields. It has revolutionized medicine, enabling us to develop targeted therapies for diseases, such as cancer. Cell biology has also shed light on developmental processes, helping us understand how life unfolds from a single cell to a complex organism. Furthermore, advancements in cellular research have given rise to biotechnology, allowing us to engineer cells for various applications, such as the production of medicines and sustainable fuels.\n\nHost: And there you have it, folks- the captivating story of cells, from Robert Hooke's Micrographia to the modern cell theory. We owe a debt of gratitude to these brilliant scientists who have explored the unseen and unravelled the mysteries of life.\n\nRemember to tune in next time as we dive into another riveting scientific topic. Until then, keep asking questions, keep exploring, and keep expanding the boundaries of knowledge.\n\n[Outro Music]\n\nHost: This has been \"Science Talks\" with your host Madeline.

It is a number that he is determined to increase. On a crisp, clear fall morning, he greeted me at the Combier distillery, in Saumur, in France's Loire Valley.

Breaux refers to it as \"the Temple,\" and, as he took me past pallets of empty bottles and a row of potted lemon tees, there was certainly a resemblance to sacred architecture: one of the region's Romanesque chapels, perhaps, with their pale limestone walls and vaulted ceilings. The narrow doorway was surmounted by a rose window, and graceful arched windows ran along one wall beneath a steep slate roof.

But there's a man, a man named Ted Breaux, who is on a mission to lift that veil.\n\nUnder the vivid canvas of a fall morning, we found ourselves at the gateway of the Combier distillery, situated in the charming Loire Valley of France. Breaux, a chemist by profession and Louisiana by origin, was there, embarking on a daring journey. His quest? To resurrect absinthe, just as it was crafted a century ago. The silhouette of Saumur's castle loomed majestically against the skyline, a spectacle reminiscent of a scene from a medieval manuscript. Beyond, the rhythmic pedalling of youthful soldiers in dark berets echoed through the streets, their destination - the hallowed Cadre Noir, a prestigious equestrian academy steeped in French military history. Amidst this backdrop of history and elegance, a quaint Second Empire building adorned with blooming roses stood defiantly \u2013 the commandant's abode.\n\nInside the distillery, lovingly referred to as \"the Temple\" by Breaux, one could feel an atmosphere akin to a sacred sanctuary. The intricate designs by Gustave Eiffel, the aged limestone walls, and high vaulted ceilings lent an ethereal quality to the structure. The air within the temple was thick with intoxicating fragrances of anise, fennel, and lucerne, underpinned by the potent aroma of alcohol. Breaux was on the verge of distilling his Verte Suisse 65, one of the three vintage recipes he was attempting to reincarnate.\n\nThe distillery, a timeless testament from 1834, was a labyrinth of intricate copper alembics and labyrinthine piping, an ambiance that would befit a Jules Verne narrative. Breaux, in a reciprocal arrangement with the owners, was allowed to utilize this living museum. Amid the chaotic arrangement of sacks of herbs and vast containers of alcohol, Breaux was focused on his mission \u2013 unlocking the secret recipe of authentic absinthe. The heart of absinthe, wormwood, known for its controversial reputation of inducing insanity, lay in an enormous plastic tub near the entrance.\n\nThe distillery was a relic of a bygone era, untouched by modern innovations in distillation technology.

Doing a soil test will further help you know your soil, and therefore what plants you can grow.\n\n2. Plan your garden\nSitting down and planning your garden is a great starting point. This way you can work out what to grow where, rather than getting carried away at the garden centre and ending up with a jumble of plants that don't look good together and might not suit your growing conditions. Planning will also enable you to use colour and structure wisely, which will help you create a garden that looks great throughout the year.\n\n3.

{"prompt": "Turn the facts in this Wikipedia article about climate change into a series of questions with answers.\n\nIn common usage, climate change describes global warming\u2014the ongoing increase in global average temperature\u2014and its effects on Earth's climate system. Climate change in a broader sense also includes previous long-term changes to Earth's climate. The current rise in global average temperature is more rapid than previous changes, and is primarily caused by humans burning fossil fuels.[2][3] Fossil fuel use, deforestation, and some agricultural and industrial practices increase greenhouse gases, notably carbon dioxide and methane.[4] Greenhouse gases absorb some of the heat that the Earth radiates after it warms from sunlight.

In response to this affront, Juno decreed that Echo would forever be deprived of her voice, only permitted to echo the words of others.\n\nThe punishment was akin to a cruel twist of fate, transforming Echo into a mere machine, a mechanical parrot bereft into the shadowy depths of the metropolis, seeking solace within its labyrinthine alleys.\n\nAmidst the towering spires and labyrinthine streets, Narcissus emerged as a figure of fascination, his cybernetic hair shimmering like a cascade of golden circuity, and his eyes glowed with the luminescence of the azure sky - an anomaly in a world cloaked in darkness.

{"prompt": "Reframe this guide on establishing a morning routine to be more silly with elements of crude humor or begrudgingness.\n\n1. Set your alarm to work for you \u2014 not against you\nThe first step to kicking your day off right is adjusting your sleep schedule to ensure you have enough time in the morning for yourself and your responsibilities. If your kids get up at 6:30 a.m., this means getting up before them. Or, even if you don\u2019t have kids or pets to care for, if you usually get up at 7 a.m. to scramble out the door by 7:30, it\u2019s time for you to start your days earlier.\n\nThat said, sleep is important. When you adjust your alarm to wake up sooner, you also need to adjust your bedtime to turn in earlier. There is nothing healthy about being sleep deprived, so aim to get at least seven hours of sleep.\n\n2. Breathe in the new day\nWhat\u2019s the first thing you do when you wake up in the morning?\n\nUnfortunately, for many people, the answer is \u201creaching for my phone.\u201d If that\u2019s you, how many minutes do you spend each morning scrolling and potentially letting stress build due to what you find on the news, social media or checking messages?\n\nWhat if you made a rule that \u2014 before reaching for you phone \u2014 you took six long, deep breaths to focus your attention on the power and blessing of your own life force?\n\nBecause the diaphragm acts as both a respiratory and core postural muscle, diaphragmatic breathing not only helps you positively focus your mind, it primes your body to support movement and good posture.\n\n3. Drink water before coffee\nBecause we lose water through our breath and sweat while we sleep, we usually wake up thirsty. Considering that the adult human body is comprised of up to 60% water, hydration is essential for good health.\n\nDrinking water first thing in the morning will not only help rehydrate you but can also jump-start your metabolism, boosting it by up to 30%, according to research.\n\n4. Move your body in all directions\nThere is a reason we instinctively stretch when we first wake up. Our bodies crave movement after being sedentary. Why not direct that instinct to be as productive as possible?\n\nRather than only doing a quick stretch in bed and then going about your day, favoring your dominant side, set your body right and prepare it for daily activity by taking it through all planes of motion, evenly using both sides of our bodies. You can accomplish this with a quick yoga flow or this 10-minute body-weight workout:\n\n5. Make time to exercise\nMaybe you can\u2019t fit in a full workout in the morning. That\u2019s OK. You can sneak in exercise by stacking it onto some of your existing morning habits. For years now, I\u2019ve been doing push-ups before I get into the shower and squats while I brush my teeth.\n\nIt\u2019s called habit stacking, a concept James Clear references in his book, \u201cAtomic Habits.\u201d By stacking a new exercise habit onto a morning habit that is already ingrained, it makes it easier to sustain.\n\n6. Set your mind right\nGive yourself a clean slate to start the day with just a few minutes of mindfulness meditation.\n\nThere are numerous apps that offer free guided meditations under 10 minutes. Or you can set a timer on your phone to whatever length and sit quietly focused on the sensations of your breath or quietly repeating a positive affirmation, mantra or intention you want to set for your day.\n\n7. Cultivate an attitude of gratitude\nResearch shows that practicing gratitude can decrease pain, enhance empathy and reduce aggression \u2014 which is a great way to start your day, especially if you have a morning commute in traffic. You can practice gratitude in the morning by waking each day to watch the sunrise, writing things you are grateful for in a journal, or incorporating a gratitude focus into your meditation.\n\nPersonally, I share a gratitude white board with my husband, and we each write three things on it nightly.

It sets a precedent that reinforces the foundation of your ability to follow through.\n\nFor more on this, check out Adm. William H.

Set your alarm to work for you \u2014 not against you\nThe first step to kicking your day off right is adjusting your sleep schedule to ensure you have enough time in the morning for yourself and your responsibilities. If your kids get up at 6:30 a.m., this means getting up before them. Or, even if you don\u2019t have kids or pets to care for, if you usually get up at 7 a.m. to scramble out the door by 7:30, it\u2019s time for you to start your days earlier.\n\nThat said, sleep is important. When you adjust your alarm to wake up sooner, you also need to adjust your bedtime to turn in earlier. There is nothing healthy about being sleep deprived, so aim to get at least seven hours of sleep.\n\n2. Breathe in the new day\nWhat\u2019s the first thing you do when you wake up in the morning?\n\nUnfortunately, for many people, the answer is \u201creaching for my phone.\u201d If that\u2019s you, how many minutes do you spend each morning scrolling and potentially letting stress build due to what you find on the news, social media or checking messages?\n\nWhat if you made a rule that \u2014 before reaching for you phone \u2014 you took six long, deep breaths to focus your attention on the power and blessing of your own life force?\n\nBecause the diaphragm acts as both a respiratory and core postural muscle, diaphragmatic breathing not only helps you positively focus your mind, it primes your body to support movement and good posture.\n\n3. Drink water before coffee\nBecause we lose water through our breath and sweat while we sleep, we usually wake up thirsty. Considering that the adult human body is comprised of up to 60% water, hydration is essential for good health.\n\nDrinking water first thing in the morning will not only help rehydrate you but can also jump-start your metabolism, boosting it by up to 30%, according to research.\n\n4. Move your body in all directions\nThere is a reason we instinctively stretch when we first wake up. Our bodies crave movement after being sedentary. Why not direct that instinct to be as productive as possible?\n\nRather than only doing a quick stretch in bed and then going about your day, favoring your dominant side, set your body right and prepare it for daily activity by taking it through all planes of motion, evenly using both sides of our bodies. You can accomplish this with a quick yoga flow or this 10-minute body-weight workout:\n\n5. Make time to exercise\nMaybe you can\u2019t fit in a full workout in the morning. That\u2019s OK. You can sneak in exercise by stacking it onto some of your existing morning habits. For years now, I\u2019ve been doing push-ups before I get into the shower and squats while I brush my teeth.\n\nIt\u2019s called habit stacking, a concept James Clear references in his book, \u201cAtomic Habits.\u201d By stacking a new exercise habit onto a morning habit that is already ingrained, it makes it easier to sustain.\n\n6. Set your mind right\nGive yourself a clean slate to start the day with just a few minutes of mindfulness meditation.\n\nThere are numerous apps that offer free guided meditations under 10 minutes. Or you can set a timer on your phone to whatever length and sit quietly focused on the sensations of your breath or quietly repeating a positive affirmation, mantra or intention you want to set for your day.\n\n7.

Your alarm clock is a tool, not a miracle worker\nWaking up in the morning is an important part of starting the day (go figure) and alarms can help remind us when we have to drag ourselves out of bed to fulfill our daily responsibilities. However, waking up early won't do anything for you if you're not going to bed early, too. Make sure you're letting yourself get your much-needed beauty sleep in the night so that you can wake up refreshed and feel less dread at the idea of getting out of bed.\n\n2. Remember how to breathe\nWhen waking up, it's important to remember basic functions such as breathing. Unfortunately, for some of us, we're quick to remember all the things we possibly missed online, and reach for a phone quicker than we are to take a moment and breathe. In the morning, make a note to remind yourself that breathing is just as important, and maybe take a minute or two to do so before you think about all the things that could've gone wrong while you were asleep. (It might help you feel less stressed while you're at it, too.)\n\n3. Hydration is important, too\nA lot of us rely on coffee to help us wake up in the morning and keep our eyes open during some of the more depressing/tiresome days. Coupled with the fact that we wake up thirsty, we might be tempted to brew a cup of joe before we've even had any water. However, it's best to start off the day with that cup of water instead, which can help you feel more alert anyway by boosting your metabolism. Remember that we're mostly made up of water, and actually having it is good for us.\n\n4. Limber up, why don't you?\nWhile you're at it, one of the things we also need after sleep is some movement. After being still in bed all night, we can get stiff and need to relieve that after waking up. Instead of just doing a quick stretch, put some effort into it and really move about. Make sure you get as much of your body, maybe even run through a quick yoga routine to make it more guided and deliberate. (Maybe more convenient, too, if you like being told what to do.)\n\n5. Speaking of moving, put your back into it!\nIt might be hard to put an exercise regimen in your morning routine, but maybe you can intersperse exercise throughout it. Maybe you could do some push-ups or sit-ups while you wait for the aforementioned cup of coffee. (If you really can't let that one go: trust me, I know.) Maybe you could also exercise while doing things that require you to stand still.\n\n6. Take a break from the endless buzz of the modern world\nGetting your mind off of all the things that the day will throw at you can bring some serious peace (once again, I know). Set aside a short amount of time like ten minutes to sit and meditate, using whatever means are the best for you. That could be an app or video which gives a guided experience, or just a timer and yourself. Whatever works best \u2014 if you can stand to be alone with your thoughts, at least.\n\n7. Be grateful for the things you have\nI know it sounds cheesy, but bear with me. Practicing gratitude in the morning \u2014 or even throughout the day \u2014 can markedly improve the way you feel and respond to the challenges of daily life. It mostly involves simple activities like taking a moment to appreciate the sunrise, writing in a journal about the things you are happy to have, or maybe focusing on them during your meditation. It can have a dramatic impact on your mood, especially if you've got a long and boorish commute in the morning.\n\n8. Clean up after yourself\nTaking some personal accountability and tidying up your bed in the morning can be big for establishing that you've got a handle on yourself. Keeping your personal space neat and clean is a way of showing yourself that you're willing to take the initiative and follow up on it. Who knew?\n\n9. Be reliable and keep at it\nThe most important thing is sticking to your guns and keeping your routine. Don't beat yourself up for small setbacks or personal failings, but don't let that get in your way, either. Reliability is key, and you kind of owe it to yourself to at least try. (I certainly know I do.)", "role": "assistant"}], "category": "Rewrite"}

{"prompt": "Summarize this text as if you were explaining it to a 5 year old:\n\"Muscles such as biceps, pectorals and quadriceps are called skeletal muscles because they attach to the skeleton to generate motion. Skeletal muscles are composed of very long, thin cells that include the full complement of organelles needed for general cellular functions. In addition, more than 90 percent of the total volume of a skeletal muscle cell is composed of muscle proteins, including the contractile proteins actin and myosin. When a muscle cell is activated by its nerve cell, the interaction of actin and myosin generates force through so-called power strokes. The total force depends on the sum of all the power strokes occurring simultaneously within all of the cells of a muscle.\n\nThe exact mechanism by which exercise enhances strength remains unclear, but its basic principles are understood. Overall, two processes appear to be involved: hypertrophy, or the enlargement of cells, and neural adaptations that enhance nerve-muscle interaction. Muscle cells subjected to regular bouts of exercise followed by periods of rest with sufficient dietary protein undergo hypertrophy as a response to the stress of training. (This should not be confused with short-term swelling due to water intake.) Enhanced muscle protein synthesis and incorporation of these proteins into cells cause hypertrophy. Because there are more potential power strokes associated with increased actin and myosin concentrations, the muscle can exhibit greater strength. Hypertrophy is aided by certain hormones and has a very strong genetic component as well.\n\nThe neural basis of muscle strength enhancement primarily involves the ability to recruit more muscle cells--and thus more power strokes--in a simultaneous manner, a process referred to as synchronous activation.

Why is that? Well to start, the things in our body that make us strong are muscles, and the muscles that are attached to our bones are called \"skeletal muscles.\" For these skeletal muscles to move, your brain sends them messages, like a phone. The receiving part of the muscles for these messages is called actin and myosin proteins. When these proteins receive the message from the brain, they tell each other about the message. When they communicate with each other, this causes something called a \"power stroke,\" which allows muscle movement.\n\nYour muscles are made up of tiny building blocks called \"muscle cells.\" To get stronger, these muscle cells have to grow in size and be able to receive more messages from the brain. When you exercise and rest, your muscle cells have to grow in size to get used to this exercise. The process of muscle cells growing in size is called \"hypertrophy.\" Since your body wants to get stronger when you exercise, it makes sense that more and more parts of muscles receive messages from your brain to move, as a \"strength in numbers\" idea. Since more power strokes are being made, you naturally become stronger. This process is called \"synchronous activation.\"\n\nOverall, the more you exercise your body, the more your muscle cells will grow through \"hypertrophy,\" and the more parts of your muscles your brain can send messages to through a process called \"synchronous activation.\" Both of these processes make you stronger!

There may be untended longings, unacknowledged grief, unrequited hopes, unexpressed love or our underlying fears and hurts. And as we get quieter still we can find ourselves facing the mystery of our own mortality, of death. In all spiritual traditions as attention is given to these problems, our understanding and compassion deepens, for it is through these that the path often unfolds.

Obstacles are bound to arise when we try to slow down our busy lives and think more critically about ourselves and our inner experience. We might discover some unfinished business our thoughts wander to. We might feel longing, grief, unexpressed love, underlying fear and hurt, or unrequited hopes. And when we really stop to analyze what is going on in our thoughts, we may even face the mystery of our own mortality. Anxious thoughts about death may be buried in there. But as we deepen our attention to these aspects of our thoughts, our understanding and compassion for ourselves and others can deepen, too. We forget we can learn the most from something that was hard, rather than something that was easy. \n\nWhen we begin a journey of therapy or deep self-reflection to heal the wounds in our minds, it is not uncommon for loneliness, fear, and doubt to emerge. We may also be forced to confront our pride, lust, laziness, and so on. Instead of resisting those feelings and moods or being surprised when they occur, we can name and acknowledge what they are in a kind way and look at them both objectively for what they are and also with compassion. Witness them, rather than feeling like you have to be subject to their will. If you don't encounter them with resistance, your mind and body can relax and the thoughts and feelings may begin to disperse. In this process, you are shifting your mindset from one that feels afflicted by these thoughts and emotions to one that looks at them more objectively, like studying clouds and watching them pass by. Sometimes, the emotions are very intense, and we won't make progress over night. But with diligent patience and curiosity, change will eventually happen. What you are really doing in this process is learning trust. You are trusting that these feelings can arise and that it is going to be okay. You are becoming more skillful about what thoughts and emotions drive your actions and mood, and which ones don't need to, including the most extreme, delightful, and terrifying thoughts. \n\nIn confronting the wounds of our mind and lives, we also discover freedom. But to do so, we must trust the process, remain patient, and be willing to investigate the deepest darkest parts of our mind.

{"prompt": "Summarize in 5 sentences the plot of the film \"What's Love Got to Do With It\" using facts from this movie review.\n\nWhen it came right down to it, in the divorce court, Ike Turner didn't even want Tina Turner to keep her name. Born as Anna Mae Bullock in Nutbush, Tenn., she was given her stage name by Ike early in their relationship. At the end, she was so eager to get away from him that she surrendered any claim to record royalties, publishing rights, and anything else, except \"Tina Turner,\" which she told the judge she had worked very hard for. \"That name's got my daddy's blood written all over it,\" Ike protested. But it would be more accurate to say it was written in Tina's own blood.\n\n\"What's Love Got to Do With It\" ranks as one of the most harrowing, uncompromising showbiz biographies I've ever seen. It is a tradition in the genre that performers must go through hard times in order to eventually arrive at fame, but few went through harder times than Tina Turner. The movie shows Ike, jealous of her talent and popularity, turning into a violent wife-beater, and it shows her putting up with a lot more than she should have, for a lot longer.\n\nThe movie begins with a prologue in which little Anna Mae can sing louder than anyone else in the Nutbush church choir. A few years later, in St. Louis, she sees Ike Turner onstage and is intoxicated by his slick charm. Part of his act consists of inviting women from the audience to sing with his band.

Born as Anna Mae Bullock in Nutbush, Tenn., she was given her stage name by Ike early in their relationship. At the end, she was so eager to get away from him that she surrendered any claim to record royalties, publishing rights, and anything else, except \"Tina Turner,\" which she told the judge she had worked very hard for. \"That name's got my daddy's blood written all over it,\" Ike protested. But it would be more accurate to say it was written in Tina's own blood.\n\n\"What's Love Got to Do With It\" ranks as one of the most harrowing, uncompromising showbiz biographies I've ever seen. It is a tradition in the genre that performers must go through hard times in order to eventually arrive at fame, but few went through harder times than Tina Turner. The movie shows Ike, jealous of her talent and popularity, turning into a violent wife-beater, and it shows her putting up with a lot more than she should have, for a lot longer.\n\nThe movie begins with a prologue in which little Anna Mae can sing louder than anyone else in the Nutbush church choir.

{"prompt": "Change this article to a list of instructions.\n\nProper Axolotl Aquarium Size\nSince axolotls are bottom-feeding animals, the height of their aquarium is not as important as the length and width of it. Reaching an adult size of up to 10 inches in length or more, your axolotl needs plenty of room to turn around and fully extend its body in any direction. If an axolotl\u2019s habitat is too small, it can cause stress for the animal, which can lead to health problems in the long term.\n\nTo accommodate the lifelong growth of your pet, we recommend nothing smaller than a 30 or 40-Gallon Breeder tank, along with a lid to prevent the axolotl from jumping out of its enclosure (it\u2019s happened before!). This is a common aquarium size and they are readily available at most pet stores and fish shops.\nAxolotl Aquarium Filtration\n\nAxolotls evolved in the relatively still waters of Lake Xochimilco in the valley of Mexico. Therefore, you should avoid using filters and equipment that produce a high amount of water flow and surface agitation in your axolotl\u2019s aquarium.\n\nAt the same time, axolotls also produce a significant amount of waste which can quickly pollute their water if there is inadequate filtration in the tank. Canister filters, hang-on-back filters, and internal filters with adjustable flow rates are all ideal\u2014providing three types of filtration (mechanical, biological, and chemical) to help your axolotl thrive.\n\nAnother benefit of these three types of filters is that they allow you to aim the filtered water towards the surface of the tank. This helps prevent a buildup of debris and small particles from accumulating and creating a glossy film on the surface of the water.\n\nA less expensive option, while not as effective, is a sponge filter. Although they lack chemical filtration, they still provide adequate mechanical and biological filtration as long as they are large enough to accommodate the filtration load of the aquarium and its resident(s).\n\nSponge filters will collect debris, waste, and other free-floating particles while simultaneously supplying plenty of surface area for beneficial bacteria to develop.\n\nFilters do not eliminate the need for regular maintenance.

It usually occurs in one episode but may reoccur. There is diffuse inflammation in multiple areas including the brainstem, spinal cord, and subcortical cerebellum. Symptoms of ADEM typically include encephalopathy (Including confusion, irritability, and aggressive multiple sclerosis resulting in somnolence to coma) as well as multifocal deficits, fever, and meningismus (Headache, photophobia, and stiff neck). Imaging detecting ADEM will consist of large (Meaning greater than one to two centimeters), multifocal, bilateral, asymmetric, and hyperintense lesions. These lesions are typically seen in the supra/infratentorial white matter on MRI FLAIR or T2-weighted images but also may be seen in gray matter, especially the thalamus and basal ganglia.\n\nAcute Optic Neuritis (AON) is a retrobulbar inflammation of the optic nerve that occurs on an acute basis. It may be associated with various neurologic conditions including MS, ADEM, NMO, or lupus; it can also occur spontaneously. It is usually unilateral and presents with lessened visual acuity, desaturation of red color, visual field deficits, and afferent pupillary defect. Symptoms typically include headache, painful eye movements, dim vision, and central visual blurring, and may produce complete loss of vision. About imaging, an MRI will frequently show gadolinium enhancement of the optic nerve.\n\nTransverse Myelitis is another condition that normally presents as a CIS but may be connected with MS or ADEM. It involves spinal cord dysfunction regularly owing to inflammatory lesion(s). It generates unilateral or bilateral sensory and/or motor deficits such as weakness, sphincter dysfunction, and paresthesias. It can sometimes present more severely, including urinary retention and paraplegia. When imaged, it will show gadolinium-enhancing lesions spreading over one or more segments on MRI.\n\nNeuromyelitis Optica (NMO) and related neuromyelitis optical spectrum disorder (NMOSD) are inflammatory conditions principally involving the spinal cord and optic nerve in the central nervous system. Features include postrema clinical syndrome, acute myelitis, optic neuritis, acute brainstem syndrome, symptomatic cerebral syndrome with NMOSD-typical lesions of the brain, and acute diencephalic clinical syndrome or symptomatic narcolepsy with NMOSD-typical diencephalic MRI lesions. NMO occurs more often in non-Caucasians, particularly Asians. When considering NMO and NMOSD, it is important to rule out Sjogrens, SLE, sarcoid, or other vasculitis. In addition to the previous features listed, symptoms may also include intractable hiccups, nausea, and/or vomiting. \n", "role": "assistant"}], "category": "Rewrite"}

While the 3060 Ti has more cores and a much wider 256-bit interface, Ada, DLSS 3 upscaling and a clock speed boost (2.3GHz base compared to the old card's 1.4GHz) theoretically help the 4060 Ti deliver more actual computing power, particularly for ray tracing and tensor-based tasks.

The flagship RTX 4060 Ti will start at $399 with 8GB of RAM when it arrives on May 24th \u2014 a full $200 less than the base 4070. It's pitched as a direct successor to the similarly-priced RTX 3060 Ti and 2060 Super, and aimed at gamers who are more interested in high frame rates at 1080p than a high resolution.\n\nThe RTX 4060 Ti is a noticeable step down from the 4070 with 4,352 CUDA cores (versus 5,888) and a 128-bit memory interface (versus 192-bit). It's a mixed bag versus its predecessor. While the 3060 Ti has more cores and a much wider 256-bit interface, Ada, DLSS 3 upscaling and a clock speed boost (2.3GHz base compared to the old card's 1.4GHz) theoretically help the 4060 Ti deliver more actual computing power, particularly for ray tracing and tensor-based tasks. It uses less power, too, with an \"average gaming power\" of 140W instead of the 3060 Ti's 197W.\n\nNVIDIA claims a roughly 15 percent average performance increase at 1080p over the 3060 Ti in games that don't use DLSS 3's frame generation, and 70 percent for those that do. You'll unsurprisingly get high 1080p frame rates in competitive titles like Counter-Strike 2 (330FPS) and Overwatch 2 (260FPS).", "role": "user"}, {"content": "NVIDIA is releasing video cards using the newest technologies and priced under $500. There are many different models in the GeForce RTX 4060 series, like the 4060 Ti which is the strongest one in the lineup. These graphic cards improve on older models and are very useful for video game enthusiasts looking for better performance.\n\nWhen looking at the RTX 4060 Ti model it is clear that it isn't as good as the 4070 since it has fewer cores and a worse interface for memory.  But it is still a small improvement over the 3060 Ti which is the older model. The technological features between models can be very different on paper, but in gaming use the 4060 Ti should still pull out ahead. One of the best parts of the new model is that it uses less power.\n\nAdditionally, the 4060 Ti increases gaming performance in 1080p fairly significantly, especially if the DLSS 3 feature is used. Many games can benefit from this like Counter-Strike 2 and Overwatch 2.", "role": "assistant"}], "category": "Rewrite"}

At Hogwarts, Harry makes two friends and an enemy. The friends are Hermione Granger (Emma Watson), whose merry face and tangled curls give Harry nudges in the direction of lightening up a little, and Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint), all pluck, luck and untamed talents.

In addition to being Oregon's highest mountain, it is one of the loftiest mountains in the nation based on its prominence, and it offers the only year-round lift-served skiing in North America.\n\nThe height assigned to Mount Hood's snow-covered peak has varied over its history. Modern sources point to three different heights: 11,249 ft (3,429 m), a 1991 adjustment of a 1986 measurement by the U.S. National Geodetic Survey (NGS),[1] 11,240 ft (3,426 m) based on a 1993 scientific expedition,[6] and 11,239 ft (3,425.6 m)[7] of slightly older origin.

But the journey that these little gems make, from formation to the jewelry store, is really quite impressive. How is a natural diamond formed? Where are diamonds found? What are diamonds made of? This precious stone poses numerous questions.\n\nSeveral loose diamonds\nIn this article, we\u2019ll explore the main ways diamonds are formed and where diamonds are found. From deep beneath the earth\u2019s surface to a well-regulated lab, you might be surprised by where these dazzling stones are found.\n\nARE DIAMONDS MADE FROM COAL?\nContrary to what you might have learned in science class, diamonds are not made from coal. The old wives\u2019 tale that diamonds were once pieces of coal that have evolved after years under high pressure and temperature is nothing more than a common myth. In fact, diamonds are actually much older than the earth\u2019s plant material, the main ingredient for coal creation.\n\nA rough diamond\nAn additional flaw in this theory is that coal seams are sedimentary rocks that often occur in horizontal layers. So what are diamonds made of? The source rocks of diamonds are found in vertical layers combined with igneous rocks. A natural diamond is made of carbon when carbon atoms bond together under pressure and form the crystals you see in diamonds.\n\nHOW ARE DIAMONDS FORMED?\nSimply put, diamond formation occurs when carbon deposits deep within the earth(approximately 90 to 125 miles below the surface) are subject to high temperature and pressure. Some stones take shape in a matter of days or months, while others take millions of years to materialize. In the case of colored diamonds, the color is caused by trace elements interacting during the diamond\u2019s formation. Additionally, it\u2019s almost impossible to determine a diamond\u2019s exact age, but inclusions of specific minerals help geologists to form an estimate.\n\nThat being said, most natural diamonds date back millions, if not billions of years. And, interestingly enough, diamond growth isn\u2019t always an uninterrupted process. A rough diamond\u2019s formation can be disturbed due to a change in temperature or pressure. The gemstone could then wait for hundreds or even millions of years for conditions to be suitable for growth to continue.\n\nMETHODS OF DIAMOND FORMATION\nThere are four main processes that are believed to be responsible for nearly all diamond deposit sites found near the earth\u2019s surface \u2013 diamond formation in the earth\u2019s mantle, diamond formation in a subduction zone, diamond formation at impact sites, and diamond formation in space.\n\nDiamond Formation in the Earth\u2019s Mantle\nGeologists believe that nearly 100% of the diamonds found in diamond mines, and thus used in engagement rings, were formed in the upper mantle and delivered to the earth\u2019s surface by a deep-source volcanic eruption. These volcanic eruptions are credited with creating the kimberlite and lamproite pipes that gemstones are found in.\n\nGeology.com explains these kimberlite pipes and their relation to diamond mining as the following, \u201cMost of these pipes do not contain diamond, or contain such a small amount of diamond that they are not of commercial interest. However, open-pit and underground mines are developed in these pipes when they contain adequate diamonds for profitable mining. Diamonds have also been weathered and eroded from some of these pipes.\u201d\n\nDiamond Formation in Subduction Zones\nThis second method of diamond formation occurs when rocks are pushed into what geologists call \u201csubduction zones\u201d by tectonic plates and then return to the surface with tiny diamonds. Interestingly, the small rough diamonds formed in subduction zones grow just 50 miles below the earth\u2019s crust at temperatures as low as 390 degrees Fahrenheit(yes, that\u2019s low compared to the usual 2,000 degrees).\n\nA diamond mine\nRocks that have journeyed to subduction zones and back are super rare. No known commercial diamonds have been found within them as they are very small and not sold by jewelers. However, an interesting discovery was made as some stones uncovered from subduction zones are believed to contain traces of oceanic crust, appearing as blue diamonds.\n\nDiamond Formation at Impact Sites\nThroughout its history, Earth has been subjected to a hit or two from a few asteroids(just ask the dinosaurs). When an asteroid collides with the earth, it produces intense pressure and temperatures, two qualities that are perfect for creating diamonds. This process can be viewed at several asteroid impact sites around the globe, two of the most popular of which are the Popigai Crater in Siberia, Russia and, the Meteor Crater in Arizona.\n\nDiamond Formation in Space\nLittle green men aren\u2019t the only things floating around in space. NASA researchers have found large amounts of nanodiamonds in some meteorites. Unfortunately, these diamonds are far too small to use for diamond jewelry or industrial abrasives, but they still make for a fun discovery.\nWhat\u2019s more, the Smithsonian found large amounts of tiny diamonds in the Allen Hills meteorite, providing more evidence that space diamonds are indeed a thing.", "prompt_id": "c045381713f91afde739dae9e9f920dbbd346e2130f111747aea67f75188a8b3", "messages": [{"content": "Rewrite this as a list of facts and explanations for a fun science magazine article for young teens.\n\nHow Are Diamonds Formed?\nFrom engagement rings to fine jewelry, diamonds are so common in our everyday lives that it\u2019s not often that we stop to think about where they came from.

Additionally, it\u2019s almost impossible to determine a diamond\u2019s exact age, but inclusions of specific minerals help geologists to form an estimate.\n\nThat being said, most natural diamonds date back millions, if not billions of years. And, interestingly enough, diamond growth isn\u2019t always an uninterrupted process. A rough diamond\u2019s formation can be disturbed due to a change in temperature or pressure. The gemstone could then wait for hundreds or even millions of years for conditions to be suitable for growth to continue.\n\nMETHODS OF DIAMOND FORMATION\nThere are four main processes that are believed to be responsible for nearly all diamond deposit sites found near the earth\u2019s surface \u2013 diamond formation in the earth\u2019s mantle, diamond formation in a subduction zone, diamond formation at impact sites, and diamond formation in space.\n\nDiamond Formation in the Earth\u2019s Mantle\nGeologists believe that nearly 100% of the diamonds found in diamond mines, and thus used in engagement rings, were formed in the upper mantle and delivered to the earth\u2019s surface by a deep-source volcanic eruption. These volcanic eruptions are credited with creating the kimberlite and lamproite pipes that gemstones are found in.\n\nGeology.com explains these kimberlite pipes and their relation to diamond mining as the following, \u201cMost of these pipes do not contain diamond, or contain such a small amount of diamond that they are not of commercial interest. However, open-pit and underground mines are developed in these pipes when they contain adequate diamonds for profitable mining. Diamonds have also been weathered and eroded from some of these pipes.\u201d\n\nDiamond Formation in Subduction Zones\nThis second method of diamond formation occurs when rocks are pushed into what geologists call \u201csubduction zones\u201d by tectonic plates and then return to the surface with tiny diamonds. Interestingly, the small rough diamonds formed in subduction zones grow just 50 miles below the earth\u2019s crust at temperatures as low as 390 degrees Fahrenheit(yes, that\u2019s low compared to the usual 2,000 degrees).\n\nA diamond mine\nRocks that have journeyed to subduction zones and back are super rare. No known commercial diamonds have been found within them as they are very small and not sold by jewelers. However, an interesting discovery was made as some stones uncovered from subduction zones are believed to contain traces of oceanic crust, appearing as blue diamonds.\n\nDiamond Formation at Impact Sites\nThroughout its history, Earth has been subjected to a hit or two from a few asteroids(just ask the dinosaurs). When an asteroid collides with the earth, it produces intense pressure and temperatures, two qualities that are perfect for creating diamonds. This process can be viewed at several asteroid impact sites around the globe, two of the most popular of which are the Popigai Crater in Siberia, Russia and, the Meteor Crater in Arizona.\n\nDiamond Formation in Space\nLittle green men aren\u2019t the only things floating around in space. NASA researchers have found large amounts of nanodiamonds in some meteorites. Unfortunately, these diamonds are far too small to use for diamond jewelry or industrial abrasives, but they still make for a fun discovery.\nWhat\u2019s more, the Smithsonian found large amounts of tiny diamonds in the Allen Hills meteorite, providing more evidence that space diamonds are indeed a thing.", "role": "user"}, {"content": "How Are Diamonds Formed?\n\nHave you ever asked yourself how diamonds form? They are so common because they are worn with all sorts of jewelry, but most people don't know where they come from. These little gems travel a long way before they reach the jewelry store. So how are they formed?\n\nIn this article, we will look at the main ways diamonds form and the places where we can find them. You will be surprised at all the facts about these sparkly stones. Here is a list of more information about diamonds:\n\n1. Diamonds are not made from coal. Some may say diamonds form from coal, but that is a myth. Diamonds are much older than the plants that were the main ingredient for coal.\n\n2. Coal seams are rocks in horizontal layers, but diamonds are in vertical layers.\n\n3. The source of diamonds is carbon. When carbon atoms bond under pressure, they form crystals; crystals are what you see when you look at a sparkly diamond.\n\n4. Diamond formation happens very deep under the surface of the planet Earth. This formation occurs 90 - 125 miles deep. Some are made quickly, in days or months, but most others take millions of years to form.\n\n5. There are colored diamonds; that color is the elements that were present during the formation of the diamond.\n\n6. In its present condition, it is impossible to determine the exact age of a diamond, but geologists who study specific minerals can estimate approximately how old they are.\n\n7. A rough diamond formation can be paused if the temperature or pressure changes. It can take a break for hundreds or even millions of years before it continues to form.\n\n8. Four main processes are responsible for most diamonds in the world: diamond formation in planet Earth's mantle, diamond formation in a subduction zone, diamond formation at impact sites, and diamond formation in space.\n\n9. The vast majority of diamonds formed in diamond mines are found in the upper mantle and come to the surface with the help of volcanic eruptions.\n\n10. Open-pit and underground mines contain enough diamonds for profitable mining.\n\n11. When rocks are moved into the subduction zones by tectonic plates, they can return to the surface with diamonds. In these subduction zones, diamonds grow only 50 miles deep at temperatures as low as 390 degrees. That's cold compared to the  2,000 degrees it usually takes!\n\n12. Rocks that have traveled to subduction zones and back are very small and not interesting for commercial use, but some stones came from that zone as blue diamonds.\n\n13. Throughout history, Earth has been impacted by a few asteroids. These asteroids created a lot of pressure and very high temperatures. These conditions are excellent for diamond formation. For this reason, diamond retrieval at asteroid impact sites is not uncommon. Diamonds are in impact sites such as the Popigai Crater in Siberia and the Meteor Crater in Arizona.\n\n14. NASA researchers have found large amounts of tiny diamonds in some meteorites. Unfortunately, these diamonds are so tiny that they are too small for the jewelry industry.\n\nSo there you have it; this is how diamonds form and appear on the Earth's surface.", "role": "assistant"}], "category": "Rewrite"}

This award was given to the best and most influential music that touched people's hearts and spirits. An amazing journey transpired from 1959 until 2022, demonstrating the vast variety of skill and ingenuity in the music industry. Domenico Modugno's \"Volare\" won the Grammy for Song of the Year in 1959. This enthralling Italian song captivated the world, bewitching listeners with its enticing melodies. As time passed, iconic tunes continued to vie for the title. With \"Michelle,\" a classic ballad that encapsulated the essence of love, the Beatles swept the world by storm in 1965. And who can forget Simon and Garfunkel's achingly beautiful \"Bridge Over Troubled Water,\" which won in 1971 and became an anthem of hope in difficult times? Unforgettable songs from the 1980s include Bette Midler's emotive powerhouse \"Wind Beneath My Wings\" and Eric Clapton's soul-stirring \"Tears in Heaven,\" a heartbreaking homage to his late son. These songs touched millions of people's hearts and made an indelible impression on the music scene. The 1990s saw the emergence of strong voices, with Celine Dion's classic ballad \"My Heart Will Go On\" from the motion picture \"Titanic\" receiving the Grammy in 1999. Songs that captured the spirit of their respective eras, like Alicia Keys' mournful \"Fallin'\" and John Mayer's reflective \"Daughters,\" were more popular in the new millennium. Over time, performers like Adele, Bruno Mars, Taylor Swift, and Billie Eilish made their marks, demonstrating their amazing skills and earning their spots among the Grammy Song of the Year winners. Each song told a distinct, original story that captivated listeners with its melodies, lyrics, and emotional resonance. The Grammy Song of the Year winners painted a vivid tapestry of music's ability to inspire, heal, and unite people, ranging from the entrancing melodies of the past to the contemporary hits of the present. These tunes adopted the role of our life's soundtrack and left a lasting impression on our memories and hearts. And as we continue on our journey into the future, the Grammy Song of the Year will continue to honor the musicians, songs, and events that have shaped our musical landscape, serving as a constant reminder of the enduring power and influence that music has on our lives.", "role": "assistant"}], "category": "Rewrite"}

What do blind people actually see? The answer, however, is not a simple one. Join us on this journey as we explore the various degrees of blindness and dive into the fascinating world of visual perception.\n\n[Scene 1: Blind from Birth]\n\n[Cut to the interview with Samuel, a blind individual, sitting in a comfortable room]\n\nSamuel: When people ask me what I see, it's hard to explain because I've never had sight. It's not like seeing darkness or blackness; it's simply nothingness. There is no frame of reference, it's like trying to see with your elbow.\n\n[Narrator's voice-over]\n\nNarrator: For those born blind, the concept of sight is entirely foreign. Samuel compares it to closing one eye while the other focuses on something. What does the closed eye see? Nothing. It's void, a world of emptiness.\n\n[Scene 2: Went Totally Blind]\n\n[Cut to the series of interviews with individuals who have lost their sight.]\n\nNarrator: But what about those who once had their sight and lost it? Their experiences can vary greatly. Some describe it as being surrounded by complete darkness, akin to being trapped in a pitch-black cave. Others may see sparks or experience vivid visual hallucinations.\n\n[Cut to a close-up of visuals resembling those experienced by individuals with Charles Bonnet Syndrome]\n\nNarrator: These \"visions' are known as Charles Bonnet syndrome, which can manifest as recognizable shapes, random patterns, or flashes of light. It's important to note that CBS is not a mental illness and is not associated with brain damage.\n\n[Scene 3: Functional Blindness]\n\n[Cut to a visually impaired person using a cane to navigate the streets.]\n\nNarrator: In addition to total blindness, there is a condition known as functional blindness. The severity of this impairment can vary, and it is often defined differently from one country to another.\n\n[Cut to a close-up of a visually impaired person's eye]\n\nNarrator: In the United States, functional blindness refers to a visual impairment where the best-corrected vision in the better eye is worse than 20/200. However, according to the World Health Organization, blindness is defined as presenting visual acuity worse than 3/60.\n\n[Cut to a visually impaired person describing their experience.]\n\nNarrator: For those who are functionally blind, what they see depends on the severity of their impairment and the specific form of visual limitation they experience.\n\n[Scene 4: Legally Blind]\n\n[Cut to an interview with Joey, a legally blind person, sitting in a living room.]\n\nJoey: My vision is hazy, and things are often out of focus. I can see colors, but they're not as vibrant or clear as for someone with normal vision. It's like constantly seeing neon speckles that are always moving and changing colors.\n\n[Narrator's voiceover]\n\nNarrator: Joey, who is considered legally blind with 20/400 vision, explains the challenges he faces. While he can perceive large objects and people, his visual acuity is greatly diminished.\n\n[Scene 5: Light Perception and Tunnel Vision]\n\n[Cut to a visually impaired person observing a light turning on and off]\n\nNarrator: For some individuals, even though they can't form clear images, they still have light perception. They can discern when lights are on or off, distinguishing between brightness and darkness.\n\n[Cut to a person with tunnel vision navigating a crowded street]\n\nNarrator: Others may have a condition called tunnel vision. Within a limited radius, their vision may be relatively normal. However, they cannot see objects beyond a small cone of less than 10 degrees.\n\n[Conclusion]\n\n[Narrator's voiceover]\n\nNarrator: So, what do blind people see? The answer is complex and multifaceted. From the emptiness experienced by those born blind to the varying perceptions of individuals who have lost their sight, it's clear that there is no single answer. The world of visual perception is as diverse as the people who inhabit it.\n\n[Closing shot: Fade out to black and white with the title \"What Do Blind People See?\" lingering on the screen.]", "role": "assistant"}], "category": "Rewrite"}

{"prompt": "Explain the process of lightning formation to a middle schooler.\n\nThe conditions needed to produce lightning have been known for some time. However, exactly how lightning forms has never been verified, so there is room for debate.\n\nLeading theories focus around separation of electric charge and generation of an electric field within a thunderstorm. Recent studies also indicate that ice, hail, and semi-frozen water drops are essential to lightning development. Storms that fail to produce large quantities of ice usually fail to produce lightning.\n\nForecasting when and where lightning will strike is not yet possible and most likely never will be. But by educating yourself about lightning and learning some basic safety rules, you, your family, and your friends can avoid needless exposure to the dangers of one of the most capricious and unpredictable forces of nature.\n\nThunderstorms have very turbulent environments. Strong updrafts and downdrafts occur with regularity and within close proximity to each other. The updrafts transport small liquid water droplets from the lower regions of the storm to heights between 35,000 and 70,000 feet, which is miles above the freezing level.\n\nMeanwhile, downdrafts transport hail and ice from the frozen upper regions of the storm. When these collide, the water droplets freeze and release heat. This heat in turn keeps the surface of the hail and ice slightly warmer than their surrounding environment, and a \"soft hail\", or \"graupel\", forms.\n\nWhen graupel collides with additional water droplets and ice particles, a critical phenomenon occurs: electrons are sheared off of the ascending particles and collect on the descending particles. Because electrons carry a negative charge, the result is a storm cloud with a negatively charged base and a positively charged top.\n\nIn the world of electricity, opposites attract and insulators inhibit. As positive and negative charges begin to separate within the cloud, an electric field is generated between its top and base. Further separation of these charges into pools of positive and negative regions results in a strengthening of the electric field.\n\nHowever, the atmosphere is a very good insulator that inhibits electric flow, so a TREMENDOUS amount of charge has to build up before lightning can occur. When that charge threshold is reached, the strength of the electric field overpowers the atmosphere's insulating properties, and lightning results.\n\nThe electric field within the storm is not the only one that develops. Below the negatively charged storm base, positive charge begins to pool within the surface of the Earth (see image right).\n\nThis positive charge will shadow the storm wherever it goes and is responsible for cloud-to-ground lightning. However, the electric field within the storm is much stronger than the one between the storm base and the Earth's surface, so most lightning (~75-80%) occurs within the storm cloud itself.\nHow Lightning Develops Between The Cloud And The Ground\n\n\nIt is invisible to the human eye and shoots to the ground in a series of rapid steps, each occurring in less time than it takes to blink. As the negative leader approaches the ground, positive charge collects in the ground and in objects on the ground.\n\nWhen these channels connect, the resulting electrical transfer is what we see as lightning. After the initial lightning stroke, if enough charge is leftover, additional lightning strokes will use the same channel, giving the bolt its flickering appearance. \n\nTake it to the MAX! The Lightning Process: Keeping in Step\n\nTall objects, such as trees and skyscrapers, are commonly struck by lightning. Mountains also make good targets. This is because their tops are closer to the base of the storm cloud.\n\nRemember, the atmosphere is a good electrical insulator. The less distance the lightning has to burn through, the easier it is for it to strike.\n\nHowever, this does not always mean tall objects will be struck. Lightning can strike the ground in an open field even if the tree line is nearby - it all depends on where the charges accumulate.\n", "prompt_id": "15544a9384ddd8308b07862abe845e06163e6fe45b6b23cb66dd8d6eb34f25d6", "messages": [{"content": "Explain the process of lightning formation to a middle schooler.\n\nThe conditions needed to produce lightning have been known for some time.

Recent studies also indicate that ice, hail, and semi-frozen water drops are essential to lightning development. Storms that fail to produce large quantities of ice usually fail to produce lightning.\n\nForecasting when and where lightning will strike is not yet possible and most likely never will be. But by educating yourself about lightning and learning some basic safety rules, you, your family, and your friends can avoid needless exposure to the dangers of one of the most capricious and unpredictable forces of nature.\n\nThunderstorms have very turbulent environments. Strong updrafts and downdrafts occur with regularity and within close proximity to each other. The updrafts transport small liquid water droplets from the lower regions of the storm to heights between 35,000 and 70,000 feet, which is miles above the freezing level.\n\nMeanwhile, downdrafts transport hail and ice from the frozen upper regions of the storm. When these collide, the water droplets freeze and release heat. This heat in turn keeps the surface of the hail and ice slightly warmer than their surrounding environment, and a \"soft hail\", or \"graupel\", forms.\n\nWhen graupel collides with additional water droplets and ice particles, a critical phenomenon occurs: electrons are sheared off of the ascending particles and collect on the descending particles. Because electrons carry a negative charge, the result is a storm cloud with a negatively charged base and a positively charged top.\n\nIn the world of electricity, opposites attract and insulators inhibit. As positive and negative charges begin to separate within the cloud, an electric field is generated between its top and base. Further separation of these charges into pools of positive and negative regions results in a strengthening of the electric field.\n\nHowever, the atmosphere is a very good insulator that inhibits electric flow, so a TREMENDOUS amount of charge has to build up before lightning can occur. When that charge threshold is reached, the strength of the electric field overpowers the atmosphere's insulating properties, and lightning results.\n\nThe electric field within the storm is not the only one that develops. Below the negatively charged storm base, positive charge begins to pool within the surface of the Earth (see image right).\n\nThis positive charge will shadow the storm wherever it goes and is responsible for cloud-to-ground lightning. However, the electric field within the storm is much stronger than the one between the storm base and the Earth's surface, so most lightning (~75-80%) occurs within the storm cloud itself.\nHow Lightning Develops Between The Cloud And The Ground\n\n\nIt is invisible to the human eye and shoots to the ground in a series of rapid steps, each occurring in less time than it takes to blink. As the negative leader approaches the ground, positive charge collects in the ground and in objects on the ground.\n\nWhen these channels connect, the resulting electrical transfer is what we see as lightning. After the initial lightning stroke, if enough charge is leftover, additional lightning strokes will use the same channel, giving the bolt its flickering appearance. \n\nTake it to the MAX! The Lightning Process: Keeping in Step\n\nTall objects, such as trees and skyscrapers, are commonly struck by lightning. Mountains also make good targets. This is because their tops are closer to the base of the storm cloud.\n\nRemember, the atmosphere is a good electrical insulator. The less distance the lightning has to burn through, the easier it is for it to strike.\n\nHowever, this does not always mean tall objects will be struck. Lightning can strike the ground in an open field even if the tree line is nearby - it all depends on where the charges accumulate.\n", "role": "user"}, {"content": "Lightning is a fascinating natural phenomenon. The way it is created depends heavily on the types of clouds that are formed. It has been shown that large amounts of ice, whether that be hail or semi-frozen water, are required for lightning to form. \n\nWhen a thunderstorm cloud is formed, the top of it is positively charged and the bottom of it is negatively charged. There is something in the clouds called a \"charge threshold\" which is essentially the amount of charge the clouds together have to reach before lightning is formed. Below the negatively charged bottom part of the cloud, positively charged ions form on the Earth's surface. Since opposite charges are attracted to each other, the negatively charged cloud will send a charge out to the positively charged part of Earth's surface after the threshold is reached. This charge that reaches the Earth from the cloud is lightning.\n\nMost of the time lightning strikes, it will strike something tall like a skyscraper or tall tree. The reason for this is that the positively charged ions will travel up this tall object making the distance between the ions and the negatively charged cloud smaller. The smaller the distance, the stronger the attraction will be. This however does not mean that lightning will always strike what is closer to it, if a flat surface has more positive ions than the taller surface, lightning will most likely strike the flat surface since the attraction would still be stronger than the one with less distance.\n\nTo summarize, Lightning strikes depend on the amount of ice in clouds, the charge threshold of the clouds, and the strength of attraction between the negatively charged bottom part of the cloud and the positively charged parts of Earth's surface.", "role": "assistant"}], "category": "Rewrite"}

The mission, a thrilling odyssey through seven alien rocks, harbors an even grander objective: landing on a particular asteroid, christened (269) Justitia.\n\nFast forward to a Sunday, May 28, a day of revelation. The UAE bestowed a name upon this bold endeavor, baptizing it the Emirates Mission to the Asteroid Belt (EMA). \"We will perpetually strive towards the horizon, nurturing a promising future for our youth,\" avowed Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoumbin Rashid Al Maktoum, the visionary behind the UAE's ambition, its vice president, prime minister, and the ruler of Dubai.\n\nAs an ode to this great leader, the spacecraft embarking on this voyage was named MBR Explorer.

This celestial dance, a common strategy to conserve fuel, also serves as an opportunity for the spacecraft to flex its scientific muscles, testing its tools on these celestial bodies.\n\nThe culmination of this adventure would arrive in 2034 when MBR Explorer makes its historic touchdown on Justitia. This ancient rock could harbor the blueprint of life itself, organic molecules. These are the seeds from which, under favorable conditions, life could spring.\n\nThe scientific community continually seeks the presence of water and organics throughout our solar system, probing into the origins of life on our own planet.

Dinosaurs were some of these animals and at one point something very sad happened. All of them suddenly died. We say they went extinct. Most likely this happened because a very large rock from space hit our planet. We call this kind of rock an asteroid.\n\nThe asteroid was travelling very fast through space and when it hit the Earth, it made a giant hole called a crater. Everything was destroyed and a lot of black powder called soot went flying into the air and all around the planet. There was so much of this black powder that the Sun was blocked out a little. It wasn't bright enough on Earth for the plants to grow normally anymore.\n\nBecause the plants couldn't grow well, all other living beings were affected as well. The animals that only eat plants didn't have enough food to survive. Because there were not many plant-eating animals, the meat-eating animals also didn't have enough food anymore. The conditions were becoming more and more difficult for all living creatures on land and in the sea.\n\nBecause this happened so long ago, it's hard to know everything, but we know for sure that it was a very big event and that it affected all organisms from the tiniest living beings all the way to dinosaurs.

He had followed her every day, trying to catch her attention, but she never noticed him. She seemed to be lost in her own thoughts, oblivious to his admiration.

This groundbreaking proposal, if embraced, could pave the way for the next generation of proficient AI models, transcending the Transformer architecture that underpins models such as GPT-4 and Bard, and unleashing novel capacities in content generation.\n\nThe Constraints of Current Models\nContemporary high-performing generative AI models, like OpenAI's GPT-4, are grounded in the Transformer architecture. Initially introduced by Google researchers in 2017, this architecture forms the backbone of emergent AI models, facilitating an understanding of nuanced inputs and generating extensive sentences and documents.\n\nNonetheless, Meta's AI research team posits that the prevailing Transformer architecture might be reaching its threshold. They highlight two significant flaws inherent in the design:\n\nWith the increase in the length of inputs and outputs, self-attention scales dramatically. As each word processed or produced by a Transformer language model requires attention to all other words, the computation becomes highly intensive for thousands of words, whereas it's less problematic for smaller word counts.\n\nFeedforward networks, which aid language models in comprehending and processing words through a sequence of mathematical operations and transformations, struggle with scalability on a per-position basis. These networks operate on character groups or \"positions\" independently, leading to substantial computational expenses.\n\nMegabyte Model: The Game Changer\nThe Megabyte model, introduced by Meta AI, showcases a uniquely different architecture, dividing a sequence of inputs and outputs into \"patches\" rather than individual tokens. Within each patch, a local AI model generates results, while a global model manages and harmonizes the final output across all patches.\n\nThis methodology addresses the scalability challenges prevalent in today's AI models. The Megabyte model's patch system permits a single feedforward network to operate on a patch encompassing multiple tokens. Researchers found that this patch approach effectively counters the issue of self-attention scaling.\n\nThe patch model enables Megabyte to perform calculations in parallel, a stark contrast to traditional Transformers performing computations serially. Even when a base model has more parameters, this results in significant efficiencies. Experiments indicated that Megabyte, utilizing a 1.5B parameter model, could generate sequences 40% quicker than a Transformer model operating on 350M parameters.\n\nUsing several tests to determine the limits of this approach, researchers discovered that the Megabyte model's maximum capacity exceeded 1.2M tokens. For comparison, OpenAI's GPT-4 has a limit of 32,000 tokens, while Anthropic's Claude has a limit of 100,000 tokens.\n\nShaping the AI Future\nAs the AI arms race progresses, AI model enhancements largely stem from training on an ever-growing number of parameters, which are the values learned during an AI model's training phase. While GPT-3.5 was trained on 175B parameters, there's speculation that the more capable GPT-4 was trained on 1 trillion parameters.\n\nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman recently suggested a shift in strategy, confirming that the company is thinking beyond training colossal models and is zeroing in on other optimizations.

But advances in digital therapies, using games and virtual reality, can make rehabilitation easier and are encouraging patients to make faster progress.\n\nAmputees can suffer from severe phantom limb pain as well as coordination problems caused by losing an arm or leg. To address this, neurotechnology company MindMaze created a virtual reality experience that fools the patient\u2019s brain into thinking their severed limb is still attached, helping them to manage the pain.\n\nThe company also develops games using body motion capture cameras and movement sensors to rehabilitate patients and restore movement. Thousands have received MindMaze gaming therapy in clinics around the world. And crucially, VR and games are an injection of fun into what could be an uncomfortable, difficult and tiring process.\n\nStroke patients struggling to recover movement, fine motor skills, and cognitive function can work their way back to fitness with the help of an animated dolphin character in \u2018MindPod\u2019. The game uses an anti-gravity vest that lifts the arm and makes it easier to control the dolphin in its undersea environment, or even do backflips out of the water.\n\nGames like MindPod are also being used to address degenerative brain conditions such as Alzheimer\u2019s or Parkinson\u2019s disease, and dementia. The US Department of Defence has funded a trial to see how it can prevent dementia for war veterans with traumatic brain injury.\n\nSerious physical and neurological disorders mean that therapeutic games need to be built on solid foundations. University of California San Francisco (UCSF) video game research showed that games could be used to help older people improve their cognitive control and multitasking skills.\n\nNeuroRacer was a simple 3D racing game developed at the university that showed how, in just hours, games training could reverse certain negative effects of aging, and might also help with disorders like ADHD and depression.\n\nNow it seems the coronavirus pandemic has accelerated the uptake of gaming therapies.

But advances in digital therapies, using games and virtual reality, can make rehabilitation easier and are encouraging patients to make faster progress.\n\nAmputees can suffer from severe phantom limb pain as well as coordination problems caused by losing an arm or leg. To address this, neurotechnology company MindMaze created a virtual reality experience that fools the patient\u2019s brain into thinking their severed limb is still attached, helping them to manage the pain.\n\nThe company also develops games using body motion capture cameras and movement sensors to rehabilitate patients and restore movement. Thousands have received MindMaze gaming therapy in clinics around the world. And crucially, VR and games are an injection of fun into what could be an uncomfortable, difficult and tiring process.\n\nStroke patients struggling to recover movement, fine motor skills, and cognitive function can work their way back to fitness with the help of an animated dolphin character in \u2018MindPod\u2019. The game uses an anti-gravity vest that lifts the arm and makes it easier to control the dolphin in its undersea environment, or even do backflips out of the water.\n\nGames like MindPod are also being used to address degenerative brain conditions such as Alzheimer\u2019s or Parkinson\u2019s disease, and dementia. The US Department of Defence has funded a trial to see how it can prevent dementia for war veterans with traumatic brain injury.\n\nSerious physical and neurological disorders mean that therapeutic games need to be built on solid foundations. University of California San Francisco (UCSF) video game research showed that games could be used to help older people improve their cognitive control and multitasking skills.\n\nNeuroRacer was a simple 3D racing game developed at the university that showed how, in just hours, games training could reverse certain negative effects of aging, and might also help with disorders like ADHD and depression.\n\nNow it seems the coronavirus pandemic has accelerated the uptake of gaming therapies.

The teacher came out to see what the fuss was and told Lamb he needed to leave because he was too much of a distraction. Although Lamb was not pleased with this reaction, he stepped away far enough for the teacher not to see him. \n\nLamb hid in the bushes keeping a clear eye on Mary until she emerged from school that day and made sure she got home safe and sound, never leaving her side that day.

Often a frilla would be the mistress of a wealthy man who was already married. The h\u00fasfreyja\nhad authority over the frilla when sharing a household.

The first, and most likely most important, thing to bring is some sort of tent or shelter. Water is another essential item to have. You will also need a lighter or matches to get a fire started. Getting a fire is important for warmth and cooking. To see at night you are going to want to have multiple different kinds of lights. You also never know when you may need to use a knife. Knives can come in handy while camping.\n\nSome things may not be essential but are extremely helpful to have with you while camping. If your going to be sleeping in a tent having a sleeping pad or air mattress makes it much more comfortable. Make sure to pack a pillow as well. Also, you're going to need a way to keep your drinks and food cold. Bring a big enough cooler that you can fit all of your items in it. A chair is another useful item since you will most likely be doing quite a bit of sitting while camping. If you're planning on chopping your own firewood you are going to need an axe or a saw.

{"prompt": "Rewrite this story to be about a sea turtle who gets tangled in a net\n\nOnce upon a time there was a shy and quiet octopus. He nearly always went about on his own because, although he wanted to have lots of friends, he was too self-conscious.\n\nOne day, the octopus was trying to catch a very slippery oyster. Before he knew it, he had tied himself into one massive knot, and he couldn't move. He tried with all his strength to wriggle free, but it was no good. In the end, despite the great embarrassment he felt at being seen in such a tangle, he had to ask for help from the passing fish. Many fish swam past, ignoring him, but one very kind little fish offered to help to untie all those tentacles from all those suckers.\n\nThe octopus felt heartily relieved when he was finally set free, but he was so shy that he didn't dare talk to the fish and make friends with him. He simply thanked the fish, and quickly swam off. Later, the octopus spent the whole night thinking that he had wasted a great opportunity to make friends with that very kind little fish.\n\nA couple of days later the octopus was resting between some rocks, when he noticed that everyone around was hurriedly swimming past. He looked into the distance and saw an enormous fish coming over to feed in that area. The octopus quickly hid; then, peeping an eye out from his hiding place, he saw that the huge fish was chasing the kind little fish who had untied him. That little fish really needed urgent help, but the big fish was so dangerous-looking that no one dared to go near. The octopus, remembering how the little fish had helped him, felt that he had to do whatever he could to come to his aid.\n\nWithout hesitating, the octopus shot out from the rocks, like a ray. He put himself right in the path of the giant fish, and before the fish could do anything about it, the octopus had shot out the biggest jet of ink of his life. He grabbed the little fish, and swam off back to hide in the rocks. Everything happened so fast that the big fish had no time to react. However, he soon recovered from the surprise. Off he went to the rocks, looking for the octopus and the little fish. Now he really wanted to gobble them down!\n\nSoon, though, he began feeling a terrible itch; first in his gills, and then in his fins, and then all over his body. It turned out that this giant fish had a very artistic nature, he adored colours; and the octopus's dark ink had given him a terrible allergy!!\nSo the big fish swam away, irritated all over.\n\nAs soon as he was gone, all the fish who had been hiding came and congratulated the octopus for being so brave. Then the little fish told them all how he had helped the octopus a few days earlier, but he had never known anyone be so grateful that they would end up doing something so dangerous.

Demographics alone cannot explain the scale of this drop. And statistics belie the argument that recent high school graduates are getting jobs instead of going to college: Workforce participation for 16- to 24-year-olds is lower than it was before Covid hit, the Bureau of Labor Statistics, or BLS, reports.\n\nFocus groups and public opinion surveys point to other, less easily solved reasons for the sharp downward trend. These include widespread and fast-growing skepticism about the value of a degree, impatience with the time it takes to get one, and costs that have finally exceeded many people\u2019s ability or willingness to pay.  \n\nThere has been a significant and steady drop nationwide in the proportion of high school graduates enrolling in college in the fall after they finish school \u2014 from a high of 70% in 2016 to 63% in 2020, the most recent year for which the figure is available, according to the National Center for Education Statistics.\n\nThe decline is even worse in some states, though not all have data for the same periods of time.\n\nThe proportion of high school graduates in Tennessee who are going directly to college, for example, has fallen to 53% \u2014 down 11 percentage points since 2017. In Indiana, it dropped to 53% in 2020, down 12 percentage points from five years earlier and a pace state Commissioner for Higher Education Chris Lowery has called \u201calarming.\u201d\n\nAmericans are increasingly dubious about the need to go to college. Fewer than 1 in 3 adults now say a degree is worth the cost, according to a survey by the nonprofit Strada Education Network, which conducts research into and financially supports ways of expanding access to higher education.\n\nMeanwhile, months of discussion about whether the Biden administration will forgive all or some student loan debt has had the unintended consequence of reminding prospective learners how much people before them had to borrow to pay for college.\n\nSo has the fact that many of their parents are still paying back their own student loans.\nFrom 2015 to 2019, Americans\u2019 faith in higher education dropped more than their confidence in any other institution measured by the Gallup polling organization \u2014 an extraordinary erosion of trust, considering that this list includes the presidency, Congress, big business and the criminal justice system.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s anti-elitism, anti-institutionalism, a perception that cost is out of control,\u201d said Stephanie Marken, a partner in Gallup\u2019s education division.\n\nThe problems have been evident for years, but colleges and universities in general have done little to address them.\n\nThey continue to advertise prices that few consumers actually pay but that discourage many from applying. They bury students in red tape, which is especially confounding for the increasing number of would-be applicants whose parents never went to college. And they often fail to make clear connections between academic disciplines and careers or keep up with the demands of the fast-moving labor market. \n\nA degree does, in fact, still pay off. Workers with bachelor\u2019s degrees earn 67% more than people with only high school diplomas, according to the BLS.

So some of them are, \u2018I don\u2019t know if I can get in,\u2019 or, \u2018It will be too hard.\u2019 \u201d Her colleague, Portia Cook, was more blunt: \u201cMy kids have a shorter fuse.

The number of Americans over 24 who are going for the first time or returning to college has also steadily declined, by 12% in the five years from the spring of 2017 to the just-ended spring semester. \n\nThe United States has already fallen from second to 16th since 2000 among developed nations in the proportion of 25- to 34-year-olds with bachelor\u2019s degrees. Countries ahead of it have increased their bachelor\u2019s degree attainment during that time by an average of 177%, an analysis by an institute at the University of Pennsylvania found.\n\nEven before the pandemic, the nation was facing a shortage of more than 9 million college-educated workers over the next decade, affecting nearly every state and costing nearly $1.2 trillion in lost economic output, the center-right American Action Forum estimated. \n\nEconomic rivals \u201ccould wish nothing better but to see the share of [American] adults who go to college drop by 12 percentage points,\u201d Hicks said. \u201cIt is literally cataclysmic.\u201d\n\n", "prompt_id": "fdbed139557c483345d6de3af83b3d7d2895d753317db6c466573f8cc411fef8", "messages": [{"content": "Rewrite this article from the perspective of an incoming freshman.\n\nA little-understood backlash against higher education is driving an unprecedented decline in enrollment that experts now warn is likely to diminish people\u2019s quality of life and the nation\u2019s economic competitiveness, especially in places where the slide is most severe.\n\n\u201cWith the exception of wartime, the United States has never been through a period of declining educational attainment like this,\u201d said Michael Hicks, director of the Center for Business and Economic Research at Ball State University\u2019s Miller College of Business.\n\nThere are 4 million fewer students in college now than there were 10 years ago, a falloff many observers blame on Covid-19, a dip in the number of Americans under 18 and a strong labor market that is sucking young people straight into the workforce.\n\nBut while the pandemic certainly made things worse, the downturn took hold well before it started.

I've read all about the decline of high school graduates going to college. No one wants their parents or themselves to spend all that time and money. I had no idea why there was so much news about this topic. I got down to business and started researching. After all, I'm about to go on this journey and I want to know what I'm getting myself into. \n\nFirst, the economy stinks. The U.S. economy has been on a downward slope for some time. What does that mean? While scouring the internet, I found some information from the Director of the Center for Business and Economic Research and Ball State University. Michael Hicks stated, \"With the exception of wartime, the United States has never been through a period of declining attainment like this.\" What does this mean? I'm not sure, so I had to dig some more. Currently, there are 4 million fewer students in college than a decade ago. Of course, Covid-19 hurt these numbers. More young people went into the workforce, instead of going to college. That concept does not agree with me. I wanted a gap year off before college but not one that involved working. \n\nEven before the pandemic, college applications started declining. We can't blame the pandemic for everything. Different focus groups and surveys showed that people were skeptical that the college degree would prove results that some were willing to pay for. Statistics show that one in three don't think the degree is worth the amount of money shelled out. Think about it. When my parents went to college, the cost was less than $30,000 in some states. Now, my college education will cost closer to $50,000 with loans that will haunt me until the day I die. The conversations about worth keep coming up time and again with my friends and their parents. When my parents went to school, everyone went to college. If you didn't go to college, you were considered a bum. Not anymore. Now parents seemed relieved if their child opts out of college. \n\nStudent loans. Don't get my father started. He has been paying off his loans for the past 20 years. It seems like he will always be paying. While my parents wait to find out if the government will forgive student debt, they pay every month like clockwork. This does not appeal to me in the least. Imagine if you bought a car, but never paid it off, no matter how many years passed. Why would you want to pay off a car for 20 years? College is no different. People who don't even graduate from college still have to pay off student loans. That is a real insult. Do you think the universities are addressing this issue? Nope. \n\nHaving a degree is indeed necessary in some industries. It is also true that college grads tend to make more. However, the attitude about college being necessary has dropped from 60% to 45% according to the nonprofit Educational Credit Management Corporation. Even the ones who are already committed to college are doubting the decision. ", "role": "assistant"}], "category": "Rewrite"}

Forty years in the workforce had come and gone as he worked his way up the corporate ladder, and things never really changed. Not until 2018, when his Alabama employer began to offer a brand new benefit: As a reward for good work, employees would be offered one day of remote work. Though the concept was foreign, it intrigued Dennis, and he worked towards gaining as many remote days as possible. \n\nAs his first day of work at home passed, he felt like this was something he could get used to. The convenience was unmatched -- who wouldn't prefer a five-minute commute to the home office over twenty minutes in traffic? \n\nDennis continued to strive towards earning more of this reward and by the next year, his work week consisted of two days at home and three days in the office. Settled into the new routine, he felt he could do this forever. If he could always experience this much flexibility, maybe he didn't even have to retire... \n\nThe split allowed him the flexibility to run errands before the stores closed while picking his work up again at a time that felt more convenient. Things couldn't possibly be better. \n\nThen, in 2020, his work became fully remote. Five days of work at home seemed too good to be true; it improved his concentration and productivity, and there were far fewer meetings. For the first time since joining the workforce, Dennis had autonomy over his schedule. Working remotely for two days was fantastic, but he quickly realized that five days was the sweet spot. There was no reason to return to the office now. \n\nWhen talking with other people, Dennis seemed to notice a pattern. All of his coworkers that failed at remote work were the types of people that would attend meetings with paper and pen, pretending to look busy the entire time. But anyone who was a self-starter, who could find their own motivation, seemed to be thriving. \n\nStill, there was one more group of people he had yet to consider: The bosses. What was a boss's purpose, anyway? Did they actually do anything but micromanage their underlings? He couldn't help wondering what all of the bosses and higher-ups were doing during their remote working time, since there was nobody for them to watch or manage. If they don't see people working... what's their purpose?\n\nSure enough, another year came and went, and Dennis learned the answer. The managers and bosses needed employees back in person so desperately that they drove everybody back to the office. Well, everybody who didn't quit. \n\nAfter he had a taste of full-time remote work, Dennis knew he could never go back. When he got his call to return to his 2019 schedule of two days home and three days in-office, that was the final straw. The camel's back broke.

When Mary arrived at Walmart, she grabbed her favorite cleanser but noticed a serum next to it on the shelf that captured her attention.

Mary had never imagined that she would be nearing the age of forty and still be battling cystic acne, which has been an issue for her since she was around 12 years old.

Towards the end of our final year of school, when we turn 18, our schools organise something called a Formal, which I suppose is a bit like a prom without the romantic aspects as you\u2019re not expected to go with anybody, and the idea of promposals generally isn\u2019t something that\u2019s done here.\nNearly 10 years ago, as I was preparing to leave school, I found out that, not only did a boy in my class have a massive crush on me for years, but he was planning one of these massive \u201cpromposals\u201d that are often done at proms. He had always been a horrendous bully to me. He would go from calling me hideous and claiming that I would die alone and unloved, to stealing my friend\u2019s phone to get my number, or sneaking up behind me and cutting out strands of my hair that to keep, or going so far as to find my house through my father\u2019s distinctive car.\nNaturally, when the day for his \u201cpromposal\u201d came along, he came out with his sign in front of the entire school, and I bluntly said no and walked away.

This is similar to a prom, but with less pressure over bringing a date so promposals are not as common.\nNearly 10 years ago, my Formal was coming up and I had a massive crush on this girl. I had liked her for years and sometimes did the things teenage guys do, like negging, to get her attention. Admittedly, I had also done some awkward things like figuring out where she lived by spotting her dad's car, getting her phone number off a mutual friend, and once I took a few strands of her hair. With the the Formal coming up, I decided to be brave and plan a promposal to ask her to go with me. \nI made a sign asking her to be my date and presented it to her outside of the entire school. To my horror, she quickly said no and walked away. She didn't give any explanation or apologize for her rejection. I couldn't believe it. I tried to ask her multiple times throughout the day and told her it was cruel and mean to reject me the way she had. Some of my friends also tried to get her to at least talk to me about it. She didn't answer any of us. I was really hurt by it. \nIt's been nearly a decade, but I haven't recovered from the brutal rejection. It shattered my self-confidence and made it difficult for me to date at all. Honestly, it was so embarassing. \nRecently, a friend of mine ran into this girl while she was visiting town. He told her how I had been affected by her rejection and instead of apologizing, she told him about everything I did as a teenager that she found uncomfortable and creepy. I think she exaggerated a bit, but my friend confronted me about it and I tried to explain how it was just emotional teenage stuff. My friend then went around town telling all of our friends about this new drama. Our friends are divided as some of them knew everything at the time and agree it was just teenage stupidity. My parents found out, though, and are now pissed at me for my behaviour and said that they might not let me take over the family farm over this. Thety might give it to my younger brother instead. This would destory everything I've worked for and completely ruin my life. I don't understand why this girl is doing this to me all over again so many years later.

{"prompt": "Explain this same concept, but do so in a way that a 5th grader can understand.\n\nMelissa Murray: Let\u2019s start with the elephant in the room: the mifepristone rulings. A judge in the Amarillo division of the northern district of Texas has issued a decision that stays the FDA\u2019s approval of mifepristone. Another competing ruling in the western district of Washington requires the FDA to continue making mifepristone available to those in a number of blue states which have filed a challenge of their own to maintain mifepristone access. We have governors in states like California and Massachusetts stockpiling both mifepristone and misoprostol. Is it chaotic by design?\n\nJessica Valenti: Yes. The point is to sow so much uncertainty that even in places where abortion is legal, people don\u2019t know if they can get the care they are legally entitled to. Doctors will be afraid. Pharmacists will be afraid. And because this is all changing so quickly, that feeds into that chaos too.\n\nMelissa Murray: In June 2022, the Supreme Court issued its much-anticipated decision in Dobbs, which upheld by a 6-3 vote a Mississippi law that banned abortion at just 15 weeks\u2014and by a 5-4 vote, overruled both Casey and Roe. The Court insisted that its decision did no more than return the fraught and vexed question of abortion to the democratic process and to the people, who were rightfully the ones to decide this question. So, is Judge Kacsmaryk \u201cthe people\u201d?\n\nJessica Valenti: We always knew that it was never about state\u2019s rights. It was always about banning abortion in every single state in every possible way.\n\nWhat has been really frustrating to me in Kacsmaryk\u2019s ruling is this idea that they\u2019re doing something for women\u2019s health, that they\u2019re protecting us. It just adds salt to the wound. It makes me a little more furious than usual because it\u2019s so offensive, so insulting and so obviously false.\n\nMelissa Murray: What Jessica is referring to is the plaintiff, the Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine, arguing that mifepristone is unsafe for women despite the FDA\u2019s approval that has been in place for over 20 years.

A judge in the Amarillo division of the northern district of Texas has issued a decision that stays the FDA\u2019s approval of mifepristone. Another competing ruling in the western district of Washington requires the FDA to continue making mifepristone available to those in a number of blue states which have filed a challenge of their own to maintain mifepristone access. We have governors in states like California and Massachusetts stockpiling both mifepristone and misoprostol. Is it chaotic by design?\n\nJessica Valenti: Yes. The point is to sow so much uncertainty that even in places where abortion is legal, people don\u2019t know if they can get the care they are legally entitled to. Doctors will be afraid. Pharmacists will be afraid. And because this is all changing so quickly, that feeds into that chaos too.\n\nMelissa Murray: In June 2022, the Supreme Court issued its much-anticipated decision in Dobbs, which upheld by a 6-3 vote a Mississippi law that banned abortion at just 15 weeks\u2014and by a 5-4 vote, overruled both Casey and Roe. The Court insisted that its decision did no more than return the fraught and vexed question of abortion to the democratic process and to the people, who were rightfully the ones to decide this question. So, is Judge Kacsmaryk \u201cthe people\u201d?\n\nJessica Valenti: We always knew that it was never about state\u2019s rights. It was always about banning abortion in every single state in every possible way.\n\nWhat has been really frustrating to me in Kacsmaryk\u2019s ruling is this idea that they\u2019re doing something for women\u2019s health, that they\u2019re protecting us. It just adds salt to the wound. It makes me a little more furious than usual because it\u2019s so offensive, so insulting and so obviously false.\n\nMelissa Murray: What Jessica is referring to is the plaintiff, the Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine, arguing that mifepristone is unsafe for women despite the FDA\u2019s approval that has been in place for over 20 years.

They mention different rulings from judges in different parts of the country, which are causing confusion and uncertainty about whether people can get the care they need. This is making doctors and pharmacists worried too.\n\nThey also mention a decision by the Supreme Court in 2022 that allowed a law in Mississippi to ban abortion after just 15 weeks and overruled previous decisions protecting abortion rights. The Court said it was giving the power back to the people to decide. However, Jessica believes that the real goal has always been to ban abortion in every state.\n\nThey discuss a group called the Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine that argues mifepristone is unsafe for women, even though it has been approved by the FDA (Food and Drug Administration) for a long time. They question if this is a backlash against women's progress and an attempt to control and limit our choices.\n\nJessica believes that a big part of this is about punishing women for simply existing and making their own decisions. Abortion medication has made it easier and more private for women to have abortions, and some people don't want that. They want to make it difficult and unsafe, which is unfair and hypocritical.\n\nOverall, they raise important questions about how women's voices and rights are being considered in our society, and how we can navigate a democratic society that may not always prioritize women's perspectives.", "role": "assistant"}], "category": "Rewrite"}

Although they are a $30-plus billion market in the United States alone, vitamin A, vitamin C, vitamin E, selenium, beta-carotene, glucosamine, chondroitin, and fish oil have now flopped in study after study.\n\nIf there was one supplement that seemed sure to survive the rigorous tests, it was vitamin D. People with low levels of vitamin D in their blood have significantly higher rates of virtually every disease and disorder you can think of: cancer, diabetes, obesity, osteoporosis, heart attack, stroke, depression, cognitive impairment, autoimmune conditions, and more. The vitamin is required for calcium absorption and is thus essential for bone health, but as evidence mounted that lower levels of vitamin D were associated with so many diseases, health experts began suspecting that it was involved in many other biological processes as well.\n\nAnd they believed that most of us weren\u2019t getting enough of it.

We produced all the vitamin D we needed from the sun.\n\nBut today most of us have indoor jobs, and when we do go outside, we\u2019ve been taught to protect ourselves from dangerous UV rays, which can cause skin cancer. Sunscreen also blocks our skin from making vitamin D, but that\u2019s OK, says the American Academy of Dermatology, which takes a zero-tolerance stance on sun exposure: \u201cYou need to protect your skin from the sun every day, even when it\u2019s cloudy,\u201d it advises on its website. Better to slather on sunblock, we\u2019ve all been told, and compensate with vitamin D pills.\n\nYet vitamin D supplementation has failed spectacularly in clinical trials. Five years ago, researchers were already warning that it showed zero benefit, and the evidence has only grown stronger.

This made sense. Vitamin D is a hormone manufactured by the skin with the help of sunlight. It\u2019s difficult to obtain in sufficient quantities through diet. When our ancestors lived outdoors in tropical regions and ran around half naked, this wasn\u2019t a problem. We produced all the vitamin D we needed from the sun.\n\nBut today most of us have indoor jobs, and when we do go outside, we\u2019ve been taught to protect ourselves from dangerous UV rays, which can cause skin cancer. Sunscreen also blocks our skin from making vitamin D, but that\u2019s OK, says the American Academy of Dermatology, which takes a zero-tolerance stance on sun exposure: \u201cYou need to protect your skin from the sun every day, even when it\u2019s cloudy,\u201d it advises on its website. Better to slather on sunblock, we\u2019ve all been told, and compensate with vitamin D pills.\n\nYet vitamin D supplementation has failed spectacularly in clinical trials. Five years ago, researchers were already warning that it showed zero benefit, and the evidence has only grown stronger. In November, one of the largest and most rigorous trials of the vitamin ever conducted\u2014in which 25,871 participants received high doses for five years\u2014found no impact on cancer, heart disease, or stroke.", "role": "user"}, {"content": "\"Hey Sarah, have you noticed that supplements seem to be losing their shine lately?\" John asked, glancing at the array of vitamin bottles on the kitchen counter. \"You know, vitamin A, C, E, even fish oil, they all seem to be failing in these research studies.\"\n\nSarah, stirring her morning coffee, nodded. \"I did notice that, but it was really surprising about Vitamin D. It seemed like a sure bet, you know?\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" John agreed. \"I mean, people with lower Vitamin D levels have a higher risk of pretty much every disease you can think of - cancer, diabetes, obesity, heart diseases... the list goes on. It's also crucial for bone health because it helps absorb calcium.\"\n\nSarah furrowed her brow in thought. \"And because Vitamin D is produced by our skin through sun exposure, experts believed we weren't getting enough, especially with our modern indoor lifestyles and the whole skin cancer scare leading to excessive sunscreen use.\" \n\n\"Exactly!\" John exclaimed. \"But despite our logical assumptions, Vitamin D supplements have shown no significant benefits in clinical trials. Five years ago, researchers already began questioning its effectiveness, and recent evidence only strengthens their skepticism.\"\n\nSarah looked thoughtful. \"That's concerning, considering how many people rely on these supplements. I mean, remember that large trial conducted recently? The one with over 25,000 participants receiving high Vitamin D doses for five years? It found no impact on cancer, heart disease, or stroke.\"\n\nJohn nodded, his gaze returning to the line-up of vitamin bottles. \"It definitely makes you wonder about the validity of including supplements in our daily routines, doesn't it?\"", "role": "assistant"}], "category": "Rewrite"}

The story has apparently grown beyond the scope of the mountaineering community as many have been interviewed by the media. Allegations and critiques have come from many sources. Have climbers in the 2006 season left a man to die when he still had a chance to be saved? Sources say that Sharp tried to climb the mountain by himself with no guides, and it's said he even brought fewer oxygen bottles than normal. His guide firm in Nepal was a low-budget service that provided him service as far as Base Camp, but after that point, they expect climbers to continue as a \"loose group,\" which allows for a great deal of independence. The manager told us that Sharp didn't have enough oxygen with him for his climb and chose not to have a Sherpa guide. The question is who knew that Sharp was in trouble? If they did know, were they even qualified or capable of helping him? \n\nOne fellow climber, a double-amputee named Mark Inglis, claims that his party, along with several others, passed Sharp on their trek. He was reportedly sheltering beneath a rock overhang that was 450 metres below the summit, but none attempted a rescue. Inglis also said that 40 people had passed Sharp, but they might not have noticed him and instead thought he was the corpse nicknamed \"Green Boots.\" What Inglis didn't know was that a party of Turkish climbers did try to help Sharp, even though they were already helping an injured woman (Turkish Bur\u00e7ak Po\u00e7an). Himex has also been discussed in the commentary on Inglis and Sharp. It's interesting to note that Inglis later revises his story, claiming that at the time he was first interviewed, he was \"...physically and mentally exhausted, and in a lot of pain. He had suffered severe frostbite--he later had five fingertips amputated.\" A search of Sharp's possessions found a receipt for US$7,490 which is thought to be his entire cost for the climb. Most expeditions cost between $35,000 and $100,000, not to mention an additional $20,000 in other expenses like gear and bonuses. It is believed that Sharp summited on 14 May before beginning his descent, but on 15 May he encountered trouble. At this point, he was being passed by other climbers, and it's believed that he was experiencing hypoxia at around 300 metres from the summit.\n\nBeck Weathers, who participated in the 1996 Mount Everest expedition that ended in disaster, claims that those who are dying tend to be left behind. Apparently, he had been left for dead himself on two separate occasions but had been able to keep walking and save himself. The Tribune of Chandigarh, India describes Sharp's predicament as \"the most shameful act in the history of mountaineering.\" Nine other climbers also died in 2006, including Sherpas working for guide firms. \n\nThe Discovery Channel captures a lot of the controversy in their television program Everest: Beyond the Limit. One very important piece of  Sharp's story is shown in the program when an early-returning climber named Maxim Chaya radioed his base camp manager (Russell Brice) to say that he had found a frostbitten and unconscious climber in distress. Chaya couldn't identify Sharp because he had chosen to not identify himself to other climbers. Instead of sending help, the base camp manager assumed that Sharp was a member of a group that had already abandoned him. He told Chaya that he wouldn't be able to help Sharp on his own, so Chaya left him. Sharp's condition continued to worsen and his chances of rescue grew smaller as climbers continue to pass him in their descent. The frostbite was making his legs and feet curl, preventing him from walking, and later descending climbers were low on oxygen and strength themselves. As the day continued, time ran out for Sherpas to come back and rescue him. \n\nSharp's body remained where it was, just below the summit on the Chinese side, next to \"Green Boots.\" They shared a small rock cave that also acted as their tomb. The BBC reports that Sharp's body was removed in 2007, and Green Boots has been missing since 2014, likely moved or buried. ", "role": "assistant"}], "category": "Rewrite"}

It is becoming evident that in places where voters have a voice, they overwhelmingly support abortion rights. Recent elections and referendum outcomes have demonstrated a clear majority in favor of preserving these rights. However, despite public sentiment, Republican-led states continue to pass restrictive abortion laws, disregarding popular opinion.\n\nAbortion Wins Elections:\nRecent events have shown that the topic of abortion plays a significant role in electoral outcomes. In a closely-watched state supreme court election in Wisconsin, the pro-choice judge secured victory by a remarkable 11-point margin. Likewise, Governor Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan, along with numerous Democrats running for state legislature, achieved historic wins largely due to their support for abortion rights. As evidence of her commitment, Whitmer recently repealed Michigan's outdated abortion ban from 1931.\n\nRepublican Disregard:\nCuriously, despite the strong support for abortion rights among voters, the Republican party appears indifferent to public opinion on this matter. Throughout the years, Republicans advocated for leaving the legality of abortion to voters and democratic processes. However, in a surprising turn, they are now seizing control of the issue and disregarding their constituents' preferences. This is evident in the expansion of abortion bans in Republican-led states, even when such bans directly contradict popular sentiment.\n\nExamples of Restrictive Abortion Laws:\nTo illustrate this trend, consider the following recent developments:\nIdaho passed a law making it a criminal offense to help a minor obtain an abortion out of state, becoming the first state to do so.\nFlorida Governor Ron DeSantis signed a six-week abortion ban, which will only take effect if the state's current 15-week ban is upheld by the state Supreme Court.\nTennessee's legislature narrowly approved a bill that allows for a limited exception to the state's stringent abortion ban, permitting doctors to perform abortions to save a pregnant woman's life. However, the passage was only achieved by a small margin, as many Tennessee Republicans were reluctant to include a clearer exception for life-threatening situations.\n\nDespite overwhelming voter support for abortion rights, Republican-led states continue to implement restrictive laws that curtail access to abortion. This disconnect between public sentiment and legislative action raises concerns about the extent to which politicians are truly representing the will of their constituents. The ongoing debate surrounding abortion rights highlights the importance of understanding and participating in the democratic process to ensure that the voices of citizens are heard and respected.", "role": "assistant"}], "category": "Rewrite"}

We conclude by providing the ingredients that constitute a recipe for a happy, healthy relationship.\n\nEvery relationship has different interactional conflicts and needs. There are no one-size-fits-all solutions. These ingredients are only part of one recipe. Recognize that it could take many more than these seven to build a healthy relationship\u2014perhaps you have ingredients of your own that you would like to share.\n\n1. Owning your own happiness.\n\n\u201cI will be happy when...\u201d is a common phrase many of us can complete with that one thing we're sure would secure our eternal bliss. But our happiness does not depend on anything external, because happiness is a choice we can make. The science of positive psychology has discovered that, as humans, we need a few basic necessities to be happy, including food, shelter, warm clothing, and other such items. Once we have these, the rest of our happiness is completely up to us. A romantic partner or a good friend may add pleasure to our life but only we can find our own happiness\u2014and two independently happy people create a harmonious environment.\n\n2. Honesty and transparency.\n\nSharing thoughts and feelings honestly through direct, face-to-face interactions can prevent unnecessary ill feelings. Keeping in mind the other person\u2019s feelings, and communicating those feelings, can help to bridge any communication gaps. Even the happiest and healthiest people become upset at times, so being transparent with our emotions and words also prevents misunderstandings that can escalate into arguments.\n\n3. Compromise.\n\nLife is all about balance, and relationships should be too. It can be difficult to maintain a balanced relationship all the time. One person may need more attention while going through a tough time, or perhaps one is working extremely long hours leaving the other to pick up the slack. At times, relationships can be 80/20 or 70/30, and you may feel like you are doing most of the work, but that is OK for a time, as long as the relationship has a healthy balance overall. Learning to compromise to alleviate your partner\u2019s stress brings positivity to any relationship.\n\n4. Taking time for self-care.\n\nShared interests are important, but it is also vital that individuals take time to themselves and partake in their favorite activities to de-stress and recharge. Take one day a week, or one hour a day, to do your favorite activity by yourself, or maybe just take time to reflect and collect your thoughts. Maintaining your individual sense of self is often difficult in a relationship, but it's incredibly important.\n\n5. Agreeing to disagree.\n\nMany people try to avoid conflict, but it is important to share different opinions. The ability to have controversial conversations with loved ones in a diplomatic way is a positive trait, but sometimes you might have to agree to disagree to avoid conflict. Two individuals in a relationship are never going to agree on everything. Respect yourself and your partner\u2019s feelings, and agree that having a difference of opinion is OK; after all, different opinions and views are what make each individual unique.\n\nMost arguments in relationships are about superficial issues which cover and obscure the true \u201celephant in the room.\u201d Take the time to find and discuss that elephant with a willing partner.\n\n6. Practicing kindness.\n\nThis may be the most obvious key to a happy relationship, and yet we often become so consumed in our own lives that we forget to slow down and be kind to our partners, even in times of stress and despair. Putting the relationship first, before your needs, can really help put things into perspective. To avoid saying or doing something you\u2019ll later regret, always be kind.\n\n7. Protecting your boundaries.\n\nOutside strains can enter into a relationship and result in stress and hardship. Whether it\u2019s your in-laws, an ex, your parents, or others raising the tension, your relationship with your loved one is what is important. Sometimes it is better to establish healthy boundaries and not let these outside forces dictate your thoughts and feelings. Instead, stay focused on the two people in the relationship.\n\nAs we end this series and navigate our way through the holidays, perhaps we can reflect on the past year. If we endured any form of toxicity, hopefully we can recognize the signs, and gain the tools and wisdom we need to learn from the past and pave the way for a brighter, healthier future. After all, everyone is deserving of love and happiness.", "prompt_id": "161153422d48500000ad81679c29260f71d146e0fa0f530c547caed6aff6a2ff", "messages": [{"content": "Rewrite this article for 7 ingredients of a healthy relationship like a recipe instead.\n\n\n Verified by Psychology Today\n\nRalph Ryback M.D.\nRalph Ryback M.D.\nThe Truisms of Wellness\nThe 7 Ingredients of a Healthy Relationship\nThe toxic relationships series comes to a close with this recipe for happiness.\nPosted December 5, 2016\n\nShare on FacebookShare\nShare on TwitterTweet\nShare on LinkedInShare\nShare via EmailEmail\nDmytro Zinkevych/Shutterstock\nSource: Dmytro Zinkevych/Shutterstock\nContributed by Kristen Fuller, M.D., Sovereign Health\n\nThis series of posts has focused on recognizing toxic traits in a relationship and navigating through the feelings that can result.

It is important to agree to disagree and share different opinions, as two people will not always agree with one another. \nBe sure to add this very special ingredient, kindness. Without it, this recipe would not taste as sweet. Be kind to each other, even in times of stress or despair. \nFinally, make sure to establish healthy boundaries with people that can be an outside strain; an ex, in-laws, or even parents.

{"prompt": "Rewrite this passage about the philosopher Lao Tzu as a series of questions and answers.\n\nLao Tzu was an ancient Chinese philosopher and poet, well-known for penning the book Tao Te Ching. He was the founder of philosophy of Taoism, a religious and ethical custom of ancient China. He is largely respected as a religious deity in various traditional Chinese religious schools of thought. He is also believed by some to be an older contemporary of the famous philosopher Confucius.\n\nLao Tzu\u2019s journey began as he set foot towards the western border of China, currently Tibet. He was saddened by what he saw around him: men being diverted away from nature and the goodness it brings. A guard he met on the border asked Lao to write down his teachings as he went. This is when he wrote the famous Tao Te Ching, a 5,000 character account of his thoughts and philosophical ideas.\n\nLike various ancient Chinese philosophers, Lao Tzu made use of rhyme and rhythm, paradoxes and interesting analogies to get his point across in Tao Te Ching. In reality, the entire book can be considered as one great analogy.\n\nThe \u2018Tao Te Ching\u2019, literally meaning \u2018The Way and Its Power\u2019 presents the idea of \u2018Tao\u2019 as being the end all and be all of existence. It is extremely powerful, yet down to earth. It is the source of all being in the world. The book intends to guide people on how to return to the laws and ways of nature to maintain the balance of the Tao.\n\nTzu is also the father of the Taoist philosophy.

Though the two elements of religion and philosophy are separate, they are profoundly connected. Lao Tzu\u2019s teachings have encompassed the depths of both.\n\nTaoism focuses on leading life according to \u2018Tao\u2019 or \u2018the path\u2019. It encapsulates moral, ethical and religious Chinese customs. Tao is a concept not exclusive to Taoism; it is also found in various other Chinese philosophies. In Taoism however, it plays a major role. As per Taoism, Tao is deep and overwhelming; it is the all-encompassing. It is both the cause and the effect of every existing thing in the world.\n\nLao Tzu\u2019s philosophy was a simple one. He was against putting effort and striving, as he thought struggle is not only futile but also hinders productivity. In his theory of \u2018wu-wei\u2019, he advises to simply do nothing. By this he means not to go against the forces of nature, wait for the gush of events nature brings to you and dive right in. He advised not to struggle to change the natural order of things, but to bring spontaneity to one\u2019s actions as one holds on to the nature\u2019s way of life. Followers of Taoism believe that striving for nothing will never lead them to failure. The one who has never failed is always successful, thus becoming powerful.\n\nBy understanding this principle, Taoist debates against Confucianism and its endeavors at domination and standardization of all aspects of life, and strives for a lone, deep meditation among nature.

He was also the founder of Taoism.\n\nQuestion #2: How did Lao Tzu's journey in Tibet lead to his writing of the book \"Tao Te Ching?\"\nAnswer #2: On Lao Tzu's journey to what is currently Tibet he had a sad reaction to what was going on around him. There were men diverted away from nature and all its goodness. A guard that Lao Tzu met on his trip asked him to write down his teachings on that trip. The 5,000-character account of his thoughts on that journey became the \"Tao Te Ching.\"\n\nQuestion #3: What kinds of writing styles did Lao Tzu employ in the \"Tao Te Ching?\"\nAnswer #3: In his book, Lao Tzu used rhyme and rhythm, paradoxes, and analogies. Some have even considered the book to be one great analogy.\n\nQuestion #4: What does the title of the book mean and what is its purpose?\nAnswer #4: \"Tao Te Ching\" means \"The Way and Its Power.\" The idea is that the Tao is the end-all and be-all of existence. It is powerful, but down to earth. The book tries to guide people on how to return to the ways and laws of nature to maintain the balance of the Tao.\n\nQuestion #5: What role did Lao Tzu play in Taoism?\nAnswer #5: Lao Tzu is the father of Taoism, which is one of the three pillars of ancient Chinese thought. Taoism is both a philosophy and an organized religion and Lao Tzu's teachings encompassed the depths of both.\n\nQuestion #6: Explain the concept of Tao and what it means.\nAnswer #6: Tao is also known as \"the path.\" However, the term is not exclusive to Taoism. It appears in other Chinese religious customs, but the path plays an important role in Taoism. Tao is both the cause and effect of every living being in the world.\n\nQuestion #7: What are some of the highlights of Lao Tzu's philosophical beliefs?\nAnswer #7: Lao Tzu believed that struggling is futile and harms productivity. He believed in the theory of \"wu-wei,\" in which he advises others to do nothing. One should just wait for the events that nature brings to you rather than go against the forces of nature. Following the natural order of things, while still being spontaneous, was most important. Taoists believe that striving for nothing will never fail. Someone who has never failed is always successful and eventually powerful.\n\nQuestion #8: Did Taoism influence other things in society?\nAnswer #8: At the center of Taoism, the idea of doing nothing and achieving everything affected the way the kings treated the general public. Because of this, many think that Taoism helped shaped political philosophy as well.\n\nQuestion: #9: Is Taoism influential today?\nAnswer #9: Lao Tzu's writings continue to influence individuals and anti-authoritarian campaigns worldwide. Lao Tzu, known as \"Old Teacher,\" put a strong emphasis on the ways of nature and how sometimes doing nothing can have the largest impact on everything.", "role": "assistant"}], "category": "Rewrite"}

The wolf opened his jaws very wide and bit down as hard as he could, but the first little pig escaped and ran away to hide with the second little pig.\n\nThe wolf continued down the lane and he passed by the second house made of sticks; and he saw the house, and he smelled the pigs inside, and his mouth began to water as he thought about the fine dinner they would make.\n\nSo he knocked on the door and said:\n\n  Little pigs! Little pigs!\n  Let me in! Let me in!\nBut the little pigs saw the wolf's pointy ears through the keyhole, so they answered back:\n\n  No! No! No!\n  Not by the hairs on our chinny chin chin!\nSo the wolf showed his teeth and said:\n\n  Then I'll huff \n  and I'll puff \n  and I'll blow your house down!\nSo he huffed and he puffed and he blew the house down! The wolf was greedy and he tried to catch both pigs at once, but he was too greedy and got neither! His big jaws clamped down on nothing but air and the two little pigs scrambled away as fast as their little hooves would carry them.\n\nThe wolf chased them down the lane and he almost caught them. But they made it to the brick house and slammed the door closed before the wolf could catch them. The three little pigs they were very frightened, they knew the wolf wanted to eat them. And that was very, very true. The wolf hadn't eaten all day and he had worked up a large appetite chasing the pigs around and now he could smell all three of them inside and he knew that the three little pigs would make a lovely feast.\n\nThree Little Pigs at the Brick House\n\nSo the wolf knocked on the door and said:\n\n  Little pigs! Little pigs!\n  Let me in! Let me in!\nBut the little pigs saw the wolf's narrow eyes through the keyhole, so they answered back:\n\n  No! No! No! \n  Not by the hairs on our chinny chin chin!\nSo the wolf showed his teeth and said:\n\n  Then I'll huff \n  and I'll puff \n  and I'll blow your house down.\nWell! he huffed and he puffed. He puffed and he huffed. And he huffed, huffed, and he puffed, puffed; but he could not blow the house down. At last, he was so out of breath that he couldn't huff and he couldn't puff anymore. So he stopped to rest and thought a bit.\n\nBut this was too much. The wolf danced about with rage and swore he would come down the chimney and eat up the little pig for his supper. But while he was climbing on to the roof the little pig made up a blazing fire and put on a big pot full of water to boil. Then, just as the wolf was coming down the chimney, the little piggy pulled off the lid, and plop! in fell the wolf into the scalding water.\n\nSo the little piggy put on the cover again, boiled the wolf up, and the three little pigs ate him for supper.", "role": "user"}, {"content": "In a desolate land, deep in the hearts of darkness, an old mother pig struggled to feed her three little pigs. Desperation loomed in her eyes as she realized the harsh reality of their predicament. She sent her children out into a dangerous world to seek their fortunes because she was determined to give them a chance at survival. \n\nThe first little pig possessed a lazy soul. Hard work was a foreign concept to him and he chose to build his house out of fragile straw. Despite being a little more diligent, the second little pig lacked genuine ambition. He fashioned his dwelling from feeble sticks. Together, they passed away their time, singing, dancing, and foolishly believing in their invincibility.\n\nIn the shadows of their flimsy homes, a wolve crept, driven by hunger and a predatory instinct. Its predatory eyes spotted the straw house, and its mouth began to salivate as the alluring smell of the pig drifted through the air. The wolf growled and banged and banged on the door with a menacing tone.\n\n\"Little pig! Little pig!\nLet me in! Let me in!\"\n\nFear tightened the first little pig's heart as he glimpsed the wolf's menacing paws through the keyhole. Trembling, he replied:\n\n\"No! No! No!\nNot by the hairs on my chinny chin chin!\"\n\nEnraged, the wolf bared its fangs and snarled:\n\n\"Then I'll huff\nand I'll puff\nand I'll blow your house down.\"\n\nWith a mighty gust, it huffed and it puffed, until the flimsy straw house crumbled before its power. The wolf lunged, its jaws snapping shut with a vicious hunger. But the first little pig narrowly escaped, fleeing to seek refuge with his slightly more resourceful brother. Unfazed, the wolf continued to pursue its prey down the narrow lane. It noticed the second house, which was made of flimsy sticks. The pigs inside felt the threat after spotting the wolf's protruding ears through the keyhole. Fear flooded their bodies as they adamantly proclaimed\n\n\"No! No! No!\nNot by the hairs on our chinny chin chin!\"\n\nThe wolf's hunger swelled, consuming its senses, and clouding its judgment. It snarled, revealing sharp teeth:\n\n\"Then I'll huff\nand I'll puff\nand I'll blow your house down!\"\n\nThe wolf unleashed its fury, unleashing a tempest that tore the flimsy building to pieces. However, its greed outweighed its cunning, and the two little pigs managed to escape while frantically stamping their hooves against the ground. The chase continued an ominous pursuit in the dim light of the fading day. The three little pigs, their hearts pounding with terror, found solace within the walls of the brick house. They huddled together, aware that the wolf's insatiable appetite yearned for their flesh. And the truth was very, very real. The wolf approached the door, its breath rife with sinister intent.\n\n\"Little pigs! Little pigs!\nLet me in! Let me in!\"\n\nThe pigs, their eyes filled with dread, caught sight of the wolf's narrowed gaze through the keyhole. They mustered the strength to reply:\n\n\"No! No! No!\nNot by the hairs on our chinny chin chin!\"\n\nEnraged, the wolf's primal rage took hold. Its teeth were bared, its voice filled with malice:\n\n\"Then I'll huff\nand I'll puff\nand I'll blow your house down.\"\n\nThe wolf attacked because it was desperate. It pursued with a relentless huff and puff. But the sturdy brick house remained unmoving. impervious to the onslaught. Exhausted and breathless, the wolf succumbed to defeat, forced to pause and gather its waning strength.\n\nIn a twisted revelation, the wolf devised a diabolical plan. Frenzied with fury, it vowed to descend through the chimney and consume the little pig as its final prize. Unbeknownst to the wolf, the clever pig had stoked a blazing fire and set a cauldron of boiling water to simmer. As the wolf descended into the depths of the chimney, the pig removed the lid, and with a sudden thud, the predator plunged into the scalding inferno.\n\nThe little pig swiftly sealed the cauldron, boiling the wolf alive, its screams drowned in the bubbling fury of its demise. The three little pigs, tainted by darkness and survival, dined on their once-predator, savoring the taste of victory amidst the haunting echoes of their harrowing ordeal.\n\n\n", "role": "assistant"}], "category": "Rewrite"}

Candy, potato chips, and soda pop adorned our baskets, as if offerings to a forbidden sanctuary. It was a ceremony, a familiar dance etched into the fabric of our mundane lives. We exchanged pleasantries with the aging couple who presided over the store, disappearing into the chilled embrace of the walk-in cooler. Our hands grasped the icy allure of our chosen beverages, and with a nod of acquiescence, we sealed our fates. The transaction completed, our pockets weighed down by the weight of our guilty pleasures, we embarked on our respective paths, destined for either John's house or mine, dictated by the whims of our parents' culinary intentions.\n\nIn the realm of two average kids, our existence seemed defined by banality.\n\nBut then, one fateful day in the cold embrace of November, during our final year of high school, something inexplicable occurred. As we stepped into the cool haven of the store, our eyes met, and a silent understanding passed between us. The origin of that shared impulse eluded us, lost in the labyrinth of our subconscious minds. Without uttering a word, John and I seized three six-packs of soda, secreting them within the depths of our duffle bags. Laden with our ill-gotten carbonated treasures, we surreptitiously paid for our usual assortment of junk food, hastening to John's sanctuary or mine. In the sanctum of his bedroom, we reveled in our audacity. We consumed every drop of soda, surrendering ourselves to a tempest of sugar and caffeine-induced euphoria. We could have pilfered beer, yet our status as athletes forbade such indulgence. Jocks were not meant to succumb to inebriation within the halls of our revered institution.\n\nThe following morning, we reunited before the dawn of a new day, pledging to renounce our transgressions. One instance of juvenile innocence, perhaps forgivable, but beyond that threshold lay the realms of criminality.\n\nAnd yet, after that night's practice, we succumbed to temptation once more. And again the next day. Our shoplifting spree spanned an entire week.\n\nWith each passing theft, the intoxicating blend of thrill and guilt swelled within us.\n\nWe bantered and chuckled with the elderly store owners, masquerading behind the facade of innocence. We paid for a paltry sum of five dollars' worth of snacks while surreptitiously pocketing an additional twenty.\n\nBut then, a breaking point shattered the fragile equilibrium.\n\n\"John,\" I mustered the courage to speak. \"We have to cease this madness. We're risking everything. We'll be caught, expelled from the team, and potentially expelled from school.\"\n\n\"Just one more time,\" he retorted, his voice laced with reckless bravado. \"Come on, Pete. They're too feeble to apprehend us.\"\n\n\"I can't do it, man,\" I confessed, my resolve faltering under the weight of impending consequences.\n\n\"You've always been a coward,\" his words pierced my heart.\n\nAlone, I trudged the path homeward, while John ventured to the store. I anticipated a text or a call, a desperate plea for solidarity, a lifeline amidst the chaos. But the deafening silence persisted.\n\nAs I entered the hallowed halls of our educational institution the next morning, a gust of foreboding news greeted my ears. John had been apprehended, caught in the act of shoplifting. The inevitable questions followed. How was I involved? John and I were inseparable, two sides of the same coin.\n\nMidway through the first period, I received a summons to the principal's office. There, an assembly of authority awaited me\u2014 the principal, the superintendent, the school counselor, and the football coach. The room bore the weight of an imminent inquisition.\n\n\"Peter,\" the principal's voice reverberated, brimming with knowing authority. \"I'm certain you're aware of the reason for your presence here.\"\n\n\"Because of John,\" I answered, my voice a mere whisper.\n\n\"Yes,\" he affirmed. \"Did you know of his actions? Were you complicit?\"\n\nThe truth beckoned, a gnawing urge within me. I understood the necessity of confession. Yet, the repercussions loomed, threatening to obliterate the life I had known. Did John already divulge the extent of my involvement, implicating me in a web of guilt? Did he do the honorable thing?\n\n\"Pete,\" the principal pressed, his gaze probing the depths of my soul. \"Were you an accomplice in this crime?\"\n\n\"No, sir,\" I lied, the words a brittle facade stretched across the chasm of my deceit.\n\nThey scrutinized me, their piercing gazes unmasking my falsehood. They refused to let me escape unscathed.\n\n\"Very well, Pete,\" the principal declared, his tone laden with reluctant acceptance. \"John has already confessed to acting alone.\"\n\nI sensed the lingering doubt that clung to their minds, their unspoken suspicion of the truth. But in the absence of my confession and John's denial of my involvement, their hands were tied. John was banished from the football team, handed the penance of community service, and suspended from school for an agonizing month.\n\nDuring that interminable period of separation, we became strangers to one another. No calls, no texts. The unbreakable bond forged over years of camaraderie shattered. The weight of shame held me captive, preventing me from reaching out. I let John bear the brunt of the punishment, while I continued to play football, blissfully untouched by the spectacle of picking up litter under the scrutinizing gaze of our peers. I remained unsuspended, my reputation unscathed. Yet, an insidious undercurrent of betrayal crept through the whispers of some, as if John had betrayed me with his theft, nearly ensnaring me in the mire of his actions.\n\nWhen John finally returned to school, he averted his gaze, an impenetrable wall erected between us. And I mirrored his silent rejection. The void of our unspoken words persisted throughout the year, casting a palpable shadow over our graduation ceremony. Our parents mirrored our silence, their connection severed by the echoes of shame.\n\nUnder the cloak of darkness, amidst the revelry of a riverside kegger, we stood at opposite ends of separate campfires. Liquid courage coursed through his veins, while I abstained from its siren song. Intoxication marred his faculties, and in his altered state, he noticed my gaze fixed upon him. With a vehement motion, he hurled his beer into the fire, staggering toward me.\n\nHis fingers clenched my shirt, his grip a vice.\n\n\"You are not the person I believed you to be,\" his voice trembled with disillusionment.\n\n\"Nor are you,\" I retorted, our words a whispered lament in the abyss between us.", "role": "assistant"}], "category": "Rewrite"}

{"prompt": "Can you rewrite this list of facts to be question and answer format?\n\nFact No. 1: Diabetes is not caused just by eating too much sugar.\nA diet full of soda, sugary foods and processed foods does increase your risk for obesity, Type 2 diabetes, heart disease and other diseases, but eating too much sugar is not the main cause of diabetes. The link between sugary foods and diabetes is not as simple as you might think.\n\nType 2 diabetes, the most common form of diabetes, occurs when your body is not responsive to the amount of insulin it produces. Over time, your body isn\u2019t able to make enough insulin to maintain normal blood glucose levels. The main risk factors for this type of diabetes are being obese or overweight, or having a family history of diabetes. However, eating large amounts of sugar indirectly raises your diabetes risk by leading to weight gain and increased body fat.\n\nType 2 diabetes is typically managed with one or more of these methods:\n\nDiet\nExercise\nOral medications, injectable medications and/or insulin\nVery often, people are first diagnosed with \u201cprediabetes.\u201d This means they are at high risk for developing Type 2 diabetes.\n\nType 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease that usually develops in children or teenagers. The pancreas can't make insulin, and this lack of insulin means glucose stays in the blood and can't get into the body's cells where it is needed for energy. A family history of diabetes can play a role in Type 1 diabetes development. Although people with Type 1 diabetes still need to be careful about how much sugar they eat, sugar does not cause Type 1 diabetes.\n\nTo help manage Type 1 diabetes, you will likely require:\n\nDaily insulin shots\nCareful carbohydrate counting\nPlanning physical activity and meals to regulate your blood glucose levels\nFact No. 2: People with diabetes can enjoy sweets.\nSweets and desserts are not off limits, but enjoying a piece of birthday cake may require some planning. Northwestern Medicine Endocrinologist Jyothi Gogineni, MD, says, \u201cIt\u2019s a myth that people with diabetes can never eat sugar, but eating foods with sugar does involve being mindful and planning your meals.\u201d\n\nCookies and other sweets contain carbohydrates that increase your blood glucose levels. Counting carbohydrates every time you eat is a vital part of maintaining normal blood glucose levels. It helps people with diabetes determine how much insulin to take, too.\n\nWhen planned as part of a meal, a small amount of a high-sugar food can be substituted for other carbohydrates, such as skipping an extra piece of bread or eating less pasta, rice or potatoes. It's also important to remember that swapping out real sugar with sweeteners or choosing \u201csugar-free\u201d foods does not mean a food is carbohydrate free. These foods may contain sugar alcohols, which can increase your blood glucose levels and also have a laxative effect. Understanding food labels is an important tool for carbohydrate counting and meal planning, notes Dr. Gogineni.\n\nCocktails, wine and beer can also rock the carb counter. These beverages can be enjoyed in moderation but need to be accounted for in meal planning because alcohol can raise or lower your blood sugar levels. Dr. Gogineni suggests talking to your diabetes educator or physician for guidance and advice.\n\nFact No. 3: Having gestational diabetes does not mean your baby will have diabetes.\nAbout 9% of pregnant women will become insulin resistant during pregnancy and develop gestational diabetes. If you\u2019ve never had diabetes before, you can still develop gestational diabetes during your pregnancy. Even though your pancreas is working overtime to produce insulin, it may not be enough.\n\nIt\u2019s not your fault or your baby\u2019s fault if you\u2019ve been diagnosed with gestational diabetes. And it doesn\u2019t mean your baby will have diabetes. However, it is important to work with your obstetrician, endocrinologist, or diabetes educator to manage your diabetes. High blood sugar can cause your baby\u2019s pancreas to produce extra insulin. This may put your baby at risk for high birth weight, low blood glucose and breathing problems, as well as obesity and Type 2 diabetes later in life. For most people, this type of diabetes goes away when the pregnancy ends.\n\nFact No. 4: Diabetes can cause a lot of emotions.\nIt\u2019s common for people with diabetes to feel angry, depressed or anxious. After all, it can be stressful to test your blood glucose several times a day, monitor what you eat, and give yourself insulin shots or take medication every single day. It\u2019s easy to feel different and deny the diabetes exists, and it\u2019s easy to feel out of control, especially if your blood glucose level isn\u2019t where you\u2019d like it to be. Try and talk honestly and openly about how you feel with those around you.\n\nIf you see someone with diabetes experiencing any of these emotions, remember these are natural emotions that can become barriers to good self-care. Be mindful by learning as much as you can, so you are able to offer support and encouragement.\n\nAdditionally, remember that diabetes is a progressive condition. \u201cManaging diabetes is a livelong endeavor that may require changes in medication or lifestyle,\u201d says Dr. Gogineni. \u201cYour care team will partner with you along the way to help you control the disease through all of the changes.\u201d\n\nFact No. 5: It takes time to adjust to having diabetes.\nIf you or someone you love has just been diagnosed with diabetes, realize that adjustment takes time. After all, it takes a lot of finger pricking, blood testing, shot giving and self-monitoring to reach and maintain normal blood glucose levels over time. It also takes patience.

Almost half a century passed before the concept of chemical energy had developed sufficiently to permit the discovery (in 1845) that light energy from the sun is stored as chemical energy in products formed during photosynthesis.", "role": "user"}, {"content": "Omg, hey! So, remember how I have that soccer game tomorrow night? Well, I also have a test on photosynthesis tomorrow too! I\u2019m so busy, lol! \n\nWhile I was studying, I really thought I found some interesting stuff about a guy named Priestley, and he discovered plants could actually make oxygen. In 1771 he put this mint plant and a lit candle in a box to see what would happen. Basically, because the candle has an active flame, it\u2019s gonna use up all the air, but after a few days, he found out there was still air in the box.\n\nThen like two years later, a dude named Ingenhousz figured that the color of plants and the sunlight were related, but the subject didn\u2019t really get brought up again until 1782 when peeps found out oxygen was made out of a \u201cfixed air\u201d (it\u2019s really carbon dioxide). Then more than twenty years later, scientists found that plants get heavier when they suck up carbon dioxide and water and release oxygen.\n\n1845 was the biggest year because that\u2019s pretty much when they started using the term \u201cphotosynthesis\u201d because they needed a name for turning sunlight into chemical energy. My mind was totally blown, dude!\n\nAnyway, wish me luck tomorrow\u2026fingers crossed I pass the test and win the big game. See ya!", "role": "assistant"}], "category": "Rewrite"}

In some instances, what we have discovered agrees with other scientific studies, but in other cases, it does not.  There have been a lot of studies that focus on how climate change might cause harm to people and their environment, but these studies don't discuss any lifestyle changes.  In addition, climate change is rarely the only reason people change their lifestyles.  Extreme climate change events will help create lifestyle changes in an area.  In more wealthy countries, most lifestyle changes are planned in advance to protect people from the effects of climate change.  Most lifestyle changes in response to climate change are happening in wealthy nations, with lifestyle change reports from middle-income and low-income countries being less common.  There is not much information about lifestyle changes being created to take advantage of the changing climate, and little information exists regarding lifestyle changes that focus on women, children, and the elderly.", "role": "assistant"}], "category": "Rewrite"}

Santiago is someone with vivid dreams about important milestones in his life, however lately, Santiago has been having dreams about simple childhood memories.\n\nSantiago has a burning passion for baseball and idolizes Joe DiMaggio. After 84 days of not catching any fish, Santiago would pray to baseball players in hopes of catching a fish. Santiago is hopeful that eventually he will catch a big fish and be able to sell it to the village he lives in. \n\nEventually, through sleepless nights Santiago finds himself battling to catch a big marlin. Unfortunately, the Marlin wins the battle and escapes from Santiago's grasp. Although feeling despair, Santiago remains hopeful that he will catch a big fish the next time he finds himself in another battle.\n\nOverall what stands out in this book is the fundamental message of hope.

{"prompt": "Rewrite this into a bulleted list of key points that shed some light on how to interpret muscle soreness after exercise.\n\nHere\u2019s what muscle soreness can and cannot tell you according to science. Delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS) is something we\u2019ve all experienced and intuitively, you may think it means you had a good workout or that your muscles are growing. Indeed, soreness can be associated with muscle swelling, but that\u2019s edema, water retention in the muscle, not contractile muscle growth. Most of my subscribers are probably aware now that being sore is not necessarily a sign you had a good workout. You can get big without getting sore and getting sore doesn\u2019t guarantee you\u2019ll get big.\n\nHowever, many people still use muscle soreness as some indicator of recovery after a workout. This is also wrong. Muscle soreness correlates poorly with muscle damage, if it correlates at all. For example, here are the data from a study that measured muscle soreness and creatine kinase elevation, a measure of muscle damage, after a heavy leg day in weightlifters vs. untrained individuals. While the untrained individuals experienced far more muscle damage, soreness levels were actually a bit higher in the weightlifters. The difference in muscle damage was thus not reflected in different levels of soreness. The time-courses of muscle damage and soreness also didn\u2019t correspond well. The untrained individuals were no longer sore at day 6, yet their muscles were still very damaged.\n\nBelow are the data from another study that measured muscle soreness vs. strength recovery after endurance vs. maximal eccentric exercise. After the endurance exercise, strength recovered rapidly with most recovery in 24 hours and nearly full recovery at 48 hours (no longer significantly different from baseline), yet this period was when soreness peaked. The eccentric exercise caused considerably more neuromuscular fatigue and strength loss than the endurance training, yet ratings of soreness weren\u2019t that different compared to after the endurance exercise. Other research also finds that certain types of training, such as electrically stimulated muscle contractions, can inflict significantly more muscle damage than conventional strength training without increasing DOMS.\n\nPerhaps the best evidence of the dissociation between soreness and recovery is that training through soreness often doesn\u2019t make it worse. Many of my clients get very sore the first time they do their new workout routines, yet repeating them a few days later while they\u2019re still sore often reduces the soreness. At this point their performance is already slightly greater, indicating that soreness can persist after neuromuscular recovery and even supercompensation have completed.\n\nSoreness may not even be related to muscle damage at the cellular level. There\u2019s emerging research that muscle soreness is more closely related to our connective tissues than our contractile tissues in the muscle. Wilke & Behringer (2021) concluded: \u201cthe findings support the hypothesis that DOMS originates in the muscle-associated connective tissue rather than in the muscle itself.\u201d\n\nSoreness also has a significant neural component. Soreness isn\u2019t a direct reflection of muscle or connective tissue damage, as there\u2019s significant modulation of how much we feel a given level of damage. The repeated bout effect majorly reduces the soreness you get from any type of exercise, so you mostly get sore from novel stimuli, even if your habitual workouts are still causing damage and fatigue.\n\nMuscle soreness probably does mean there is some level of damage: you can\u2019t get sore without damage. (Phantom DOMS?) However, the magnitude of soreness doesn\u2019t correlate with the extent of muscle damage or neuromuscular fatigue and certainly not with the extent of muscle growth. You can have high levels of muscle damage or fatigue without soreness.\n\nSo basically all a sore muscle tells you is that muscle was involved in some exercise you did earlier. Some people and some body parts get much more sore than others. You mostly get sore after novel training stimuli, such as trying new exercises or higher training volumes.

A polar bear's skin is actually black.\nBeneath all that thick fur, polar bears have jet black skin. The polar bear\u2019s fur is also translucent, and only appears white because it reflects visible light.\n\n3. They can swim constantly for days at a time.\nAs well as reaching speeds of up to 6mph in the water, polar bears can swim for long distances and steadily for many hours to get from one piece of ice to another. Their large paws are specially adapted for swimming, which they\u2019ll use to paddle through the water while holding their hind legs flat like a rudder.\n\n4. Less than 2% of polar bear hunts are successful.\nAlthough about half of a polar bear\u2019s life is spent hunting for food, their hunts are rarely successful. A polar bear\u2019s main prey consists of ringed seals and bearded seals, which they hunt in a variety of ways. Either by breaking into pupping dens, waiting at breathing holes or at the water\u2019s edge, or stalking seals that have hauled out to rest on the ice.

Besides catching seals, polar bears will also scavenge carcasses or settle for small mammals, birds, eggs and vegetation.\n\n5. Scientists can extract polar bear DNA from just their footprints.\nAn innovative new technique developed by WWF and DNA specialist firm SPYGEN allows scientists to isolate DNA from a polar bear\u2019s footprint in the snow. Two tiny scoops of snow from a polar bear track revealed not just the DNA of the polar bear that made it, but even from a seal it had recently eaten.\n\n", "role": "user"}, {"content": "1. What kind of animals are polar bears ?\nPolar bears are considered marine animals because they are on the sea ice of the Arctic Ocean most of the time. After all, this is where they get their food. Polar bears are the only bears that are marine mammals.\n\n2. What is the color of a polar bear's skin, and why do they have white fur?\nA polar bear's skin is black. Although a polar bear's fur looks like it's white, it has no color. The only reason it looks like it's white is because it reflects visible light. \n\n3. How long can polar bears swim for and how do they do it?\nPolar bears can swim day after day for a steady amount of time. Not only that, but they can swim for up to 6 miles per hour in water. Polar bears can swim far for a long time, especially if they want to get from one piece of ice to another. Their big paws are designed for swimming, and they use them to paddle through the water while keeping their hind legs flat. \n\n4. How many polar bear hunts are successful, and what do they eat?\nOnly 2 out of 100 polar bear hunts are a success. Even though a polar bear spends half of its life trying to hunt for food, they are rarely lucky. A polar bear mostly eats ringed seals and bearded seals, and they hunt for them in different ways. They either break into pupping dens or follow them when they are on the ice. Polar bears also eat small mammals, birds, plants, or eggs. \n\n5. How do scientists get the DNA of a polar bear?\nThere has been a new method developed by specialists that helps scientists get DNA from a polar bear's footprint in the snow. They only need two small scoops of snow to get the DNA of a polar bear, and even the DNA of a recent meal, such as a seal.", "role": "assistant"}], "category": "Rewrite"}

Today we are going to talk about the four stages of metamorphosis of butterflies and months. \n\nDoes anyone know what metamorphosis means? Well, let me tell you, it means a \"transformation or change in shape.\"\n\nSo when a caterpillar evolves into a moth or butterfly, they go through metamorphosis. \n\nThe four stages in the metamorphosis of moths and butterflies are egg, larva, pupa, and adult. Let's talk about each stage, okay?\n\nThe first stage is the egg stage. The grown-up female butterfly lays her very tiny eggs on plants that then become food for the hatching caterpillars. She lays a lot of eggs to make sure a lot of them live, and depending on the kind of butterfly, eggs can be laid in Spring, Summer or Fall. \n\nCool, huh? \n\nOkay, let's move on to the second stage, the Larva Stage. This is also called the caterpillar stage if the insect is a butterfly or moth. In this stage, the caterpillar eats so much because the food is stored and used later as a grown-up moth or butterfly. \n\nDid you know caterpillars can grow up to 100 times their size in this stage? WOW!!! Amazing, right? \n\nThe third stage is the Pupa stage. \n\nWhen the caterpillar is fully grown and stops eating, it is called a pupa. \n\nA pupa may hang from a branch, hide in leaves, or bury underground. The pupa stage can last from a week to a month, or even longer. Some even last two years. WHAT?! \n\nThat can be a long time. \n\nNow kids, it may not look like a lot is going on from the outside, but inside so many changes are happening. Special cells in the larva are growing very fast. These special cells will become legs, wings, eyes, and other parts of the grown-up butterfly. \n\nSome of the cells in the larva will give the growing cells energy. \n\nThe fourth and final stage is the Adult Stage. The adults look very different than the larva stage. For example, look at this [picture of a caterpillar]. Caterpillars have a few tiny eyes, stubby legs and very short antennae. \n\nThe adults [show a picture of a butterfly] have long legs, long antennae, and compound eyes. Compound eyes are clusters of very small receptors that allow insects to see in multiple directions at the same time. Very different than our human eyes. \n\nAnother difference is that adults can fly using their large, colorful wings, but they can't grow. \n\nRemember when we said caterpillars can grow to 100 times their size in the larva stage? Well, adults can't do that. See, the caterpillar's job was to eat, but the female butterfly's job is to get pregnant and lay eggs. \n\nSome of the adult butterflies get their energy feeding on nectar from flowers, and some don't eat anything at all. \n\nAnother difference between caterpillars and adult butterflies is that adult butterflies can fly to find just the right plant to lay their eggs. This is important because caterpillars can't travel that far.\n\nFascinating isn't it, kids? Wow, we learned a lot today. Make sure you tell your parents and friends that you learned the four stages of the metamorphosis of butterflies and months. \n\nFirst comes the Egg Stage. \nSecond, is the Larva Stage.\nThird is the Pupa Stage.\nFourth is the Adult Stage. \n\nGood job, kids!

The island has beautiful beaches and even a giant cathedral! You won't be stuck on the aeroplane very long because the flight only takes around two hours if you're travelling from the UK, so you'll be in the bright sunshine extra quickly. In Majorca's capital city, Palma, you can visit the ancient cathedral or even go out to the countryside on a magical wooden train!

It's estimated that our galaxy is littered with 100 million small black holes (several times the mass of our Sun) created from exploded stars. The universe at large is flooded with supermassive black holes, weighing millions or billions of times our Sun\u2019s mass and found in the centers of galaxies.\n\nA long-sought missing link is an intermediate-mass black hole, weighing in somewhere between 100 and 100,000 solar masses.

NASA\u2019s Chandra X-ray observatory has also helped make many possible intermediate black hole discoveries, including a large sample in 2018.\n\nLooking much closer to home, there have been a number of suspected intermediate-mass black holes detected in dense globular star clusters orbiting our Milky Way galaxy. For example, in 2008, Hubble astronomers announced the suspected presence of an intermediate-mass black hole in the globular cluster Omega Centauri. For a number of reasons, including the need for more data, these and other intermediate-mass black hole findings still remain inconclusive and do not rule out alternative theories.\n\nHubble's unique capabilities have now been used to zero in on the core of the globular star cluster Messier 4 (M4) to go black-hole hunting with higher precision than in previous searches. \"You can't do this kind of science without Hubble,\" said Eduardo Vitral of the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore, Maryland, lead author on a paper to be published in the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society.\n\nVitral\u2019s team has detected a possible intermediate-mass black hole of roughly 800 solar masses. The suspected object can't be seen, but its mass is calculated by studying the motion of stars caught in its gravitational field, like bees swarming around a hive. Measuring their motion takes time, and a lot of precision. This is where Hubble accomplishes what no other present-day telescope can do. Astronomers looked at 12 years' worth of M4 observations from Hubble and resolved pinpoint stars.\n\nHis team estimates that the black hole in M4 could be as much as 800 times our Sun's mass. Hubble's data tend to rule out alternative theories for this object, such as a compact central cluster of unresolved stellar remnants like neutron stars, or smaller black holes swirling around each other.\n\n\"We have good confidence that we have a very tiny region with a lot of concentrated mass. It's about three times smaller than the densest dark mass that we had found before in other globular clusters,\" said Vitral. \"The region is more compact than what we can reproduce with numerical simulations when we take into account a collection of black holes, neutron stars, and white dwarfs segregated at the cluster's center.

We end up with a measurement of a dark mass extension in the cluster's center,\" said Vitral. \"The closer to the central mass, more randomly the stars are moving. And, the greater the central mass, the faster these stellar velocities.\"\n\nBecause intermediate-mass black holes in globular clusters have been so elusive, Vitral cautions, \"While we cannot completely affirm that it is a central point of gravity, we can show that it is very small.

These elusive black holes are about 100 to 100,000 times the mass of the Sun.\nIntermediate black holes often form the center of dwarf galaxies. Data from other telescopes such as the Chandra X-Ray Telescope generated several candidates for intermediate black holes in dense star clusters at the edge of other galaxies. Other intermediate black hole candidates exist at the edge of our Milky Way. These black hole candidates show signs of having masses that are tens of thousands of times the mass of our Sun. One black hole candidate was discovered in the Omega Centauri globular cluster in 2008. However, astronomers need more data to confirm that they are intermediate black holes or formulate an alternative explanation for the candidates.\nAstronomers can use Hubble Space Telescope's capabilities to search for intermediate black holes in the globular star cluster, known as Messier 4. Astronomers such as Eduardo Vitral of the Space Telescope Science Institute praised the precision with which the Hubble Space Telescope can make the required obervations.\n\"You can't do this kind of science without Hubble,\" Vitral said.\nEduardo Vitral's research team already discovered an intermediate black hole that is 800 times the mass of the Sun. They plan to publish their findings in a paper that will be published in the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society.\nIt is impossible to directly view a black hole. However, the Hubble Space Telescope can observe the motion of objects that may be moving close to a black hole. The research team used 12 years' worth of Messier 4 observations to discover the intermediate black hole. \nThe researchers' modeling of the data produced by the Hubble Space Telescope ruled out alternative theories for the behavior of these objects, such as multiple smaller black holes orbiting one another, neutron stars, or white dwarfs. A theoretical collection of small black holes would have been packed too closely together to avoid merging with other black holes or being punted out of the cluster by gravitational interactions, for instance.\nVitral acknowledged that intermediate black holes are elusive. Most known black holes are either small -- \"only\" several times the mass of our Sun -- or huge black holes like the one at the center of the Milky Way Galaxy. Astronomers also estimate that there are as many as 100 million small black holes in the Milky Way Galaxy. These small black holes often form from large stars that exploded. Large black holes typically have masses of millions or billions of times the mass of the Sun.\nHowever, with our current understanding of physics and data from the Hubble Space Telescope, an intermediate black hole is the most likely explanation for the object discovered by Eduardo Vitral's research team.", "role": "assistant"}], "category": "Rewrite"}

Hutton thought that every person has two sides but when writing about Richard III, he thought that most writers choose one side over the other. Even today, after the discovery of Richard III's skeleton in a parking lot in Leicester England, his story - and character - is still being argued about.

Philippa Langley was the person most responsible for the \"Looking for Richard\" project. In the book, she gives the story of how the project came about, how the fundraising helped, and how the dig progressed. The other writer, historian Michael Jones, is looking at the life of Richard III, including his reign and how he was killed at Bosworth Field. Jones is also questioning the disappearance of the two princes, Richard III's nephews, who were kept locked up in the Tower of London and eventually disappeared. Jones questions the fact that the boys disappeared while Richard was on the throne.

This phone had a lot of secret government information, so I couldn't afford to let anyone get their hands on it. Naturally, I had to try by all means to retrieve this phone. I first asked some divers to try and find the phone and when they couldn't find it, I asked for the dam to be drained. It took a while, but we finally found the phone at the bottom. Sadly, though, it couldn't turn on. To rub salt in the wound, I've been suspended. I think this is grossly unfair.

He becomes supported and guided by Monsignor Thayer Darcy, a Catholic priest. Upon return home from Princeton over Christmas break my character crosses paths with Isabelle Borg\u00e9. I wrote her to be a wealthy, upper-class, and fashionable young thing who first met Amory during youth. A romance develops.\n\nAmory returns to Princeton and they correspond through letters and poems. I wrote in my novel that she soon became disappointed and disillusioned. My characters break up on Long Island after prom. My protagonist graduates and then is off to the Army during World War I. I wrote him to be shipped to the Western front. I also wrote that the mother dies and all inheritance is gone. Amory learns this while overseas.\n\nOur protagonist returns to US soil and resides in New York, set in the early stages of The Jazz Age. I had to write into the plot a hateful Rosalind Connage, full of conceit and self-love. Our boy Amory is looking for a job and ends up at an advertising agency where he is ill-suited. Rosalind prefers the money of a rival suitor along with his status. Our poor boy can't compete. Amory quits his job and goes on a three-week binge fueled by alcohol and despair.\n\nI have our boy then go to Maryland to visit an uncle. I then introduce the character of Eleanor Savage, an 18-year-old atheist. She finds her community, gender roles, and religion too restrictive. Our boy and Eleanor spend their time doing little else besides talking about their romance. To make things interesting I have to add a suicide attempt by Eleanor. Amory comes to his senses at this and realizes that he couldn't love her.\n\nUpon our boy's return to New York, he learns that Rosalind is engaged and that his dearly loved mentor Monsignor Darcy has died. Amory wanders as a hopeless homeless person to Princeton catching a car ride from a wealthy man driven by a bitter chauffeur. He takes this time to share his political thoughts and develop them as he is speaking.\n\nHe lists his objections about society's current state peppered with disappointment in an ongoing argument. He hopes to be one along with others to bring about necessary reform to the important issues of his time. The wealthy man who offered Amory a ride along with his chauffeur reject the view held by our protagonist. I wrote for them to part peaceably after learning that Amory knew the man's son from Princeton. The man's son had died in the war.\n\nOn a deserted walk toward Princeton, our boy comes to terms with all of his ideologies and obsessions and abandons them.

During colder months, you want your entire property to warm up quickly and stay that way. By knowing how to address minor problems yourself, you can maintain a warm home without the need to hire an engineer and incur unnecessary costs.\n\nWhile installation of a central heating system requires a qualified professional, maintaining it is relatively simple, with most tasks being quick to complete. We'll guide you through troubleshooting common radiator issues, such as noise or insufficient heat, and teach you essential skills like bleeding your radiator.\n\nQ: How does a radiator work?\nUnderstanding how a radiator works is key. In a wet central heating system, a boiler heats water, which is then circulated through a network of pipes to radiators throughout the house. Each radiator is equipped with valves that control the water flow, determining the amount of time the water spends in the radiator and the heat emitted. After leaving the radiator, the water returns to the boiler for reheating.\n\nWhile some heat is lost as water flows through the pipes, the efficient design minimizes this loss. Narrow pipes and multiple short circuits radiating from the pump ensure that each radiator heats up as efficiently as the first one.\n\nBy following our guidance, you'll be able to troubleshoot common radiator problems, such as bleeding air from the system or addressing issues with valves and thermostats. However, should the problem persist or if you're uncertain about any aspect, it's advisable to seek professional assistance. Their expertise will ensure accurate diagnosis and effective solutions, preventing further complications.\n\nRemember, regular maintenance and timely intervention are essential for optimal radiator performance, keeping your home warm and cozy throughout the heating season.", "role": "assistant"}], "category": "Rewrite"}

{"prompt": "Rewrite this Reddit post from the perspective of the mum who was refused a haircut for her daughter.\n\nI\u2019m a hair stylist.

When the mum booked the trim and colour in, she specified that her daughter had long hair and asked if that was ok for me to handle. The receptionist said yes because I have a lot of clients with waist length hair. Waist length is usually the longest hair I will cut, I have never had a client with hair longer than this. Due to issues with my knee, I can\u2019t kneel down for long. I\u2019m awaiting surgery.\nWhen they turned up for the appointment, the daughter had her hair up in a bun so I couldn\u2019t see the full length of her hair. The mum thanked me for being able to fit her daughter in, she said that when their usual stylist isn\u2019t available, it can be difficult to get her daughter an appointment due to her hair length. When the daughter sat in my chair, I asked her to take her hair down so that I could brush through it before we started her ombre colour. When she took her hair down, I noticed it was much longer than I expected. I asked her how long her hair was, and she said it was knee length. She brushed her hair back so that it was all going down the back of the chair and it was well past the length I was comfortable cutting at. I would have had to kneel down the colour and cut her hair. I waved the mum over as I told the daughter to take off the gown. I apologised to the mum and told her that I would not be able to cut her daughter\u2019s hair due to it\u2019s length. I explained that it was too long for me to cut as I could not kneel down to cut her hair.\nUnderstandably, the mum was upset that I was refusing to cut her daughter\u2019s hair.

Because of the length of her hair, it can be challenging to find a hair stylist who will work on her. Our usual stylist is away on holiday, but my friend recommended someone new to try. So I called the salon to book a trim and an ombre colour. When I spoke to the receptionist, I specifically asked if the stylist could cut long hair. The receptionist assured me that this stylist was fine with long hair. \nMy daughter and I went to the salon for our appointment with my daughter's hair tied up in a bun. I met the new stylist and thanked her for fitting my daughter in since, again, we weren't regular clients and my daughter has long hair. The stylist took my daughter to the chair, covered her with the gown, and then asked my daughter to take her hair down to be brushed out. My daughter did as she was asked and then everything went wrong. The stylist immediately waved me over while telling my daughter to remove the gown. When I asked what the problem was, the stylist told me that my daughter's hair was too long. \nI was upset as I had specifically said she had long hair when booking the appointment. The stylist explained that she assumed long hair meant waist length, not knee length as my daughter's hair is and that she couldn't physically cut it because she has knee problems that prevent her from kneeling to do so. This was never conveyed to me before the appointment, so I requested my \u00a350 booking fee be refunded. This is when things got worse. The stylist refused to refund the booking fee and insisted that I was told it was non-refundable when I booked, but clearly they didn't communicate with me the requirements on hair length while I was booking either. I demanded to speak to the manager. \nThe stylist brought the owner over who did agree to refund the \u00a350. The stylist again tried to blame me for the ordeal by insisting I should have been more specific about the hair length, but neither the stylist nor receptionist ever asked me for more details so I didn't expect it to be a problem. I was angry at the behaviour and contempt shown to me and my daughter by the stylist so after we left, I went onto the salon's Facebook stage to leave a detailed review of my experience and warn everyone that this stylist doesn't actually cut long hair necessarily. I'm still upset at the way my daughter and I were treated. ", "role": "assistant"}], "category": "Rewrite"}

He fidgeted and twitched with anxiety, noticing every flicker of a shadow as it danced in the twilight. At the faintest sound, like a branch brushing against the roof, the young man's pulse quickened. He would cock his head like a dog trying to pinpoint the exact source of a creak in the floor. At night, he chased imagined noises. He was confident that he could hear voices above and below his bed, but he couldn't quite make out what they were discussing. Was it him?\n\nIt wasn't always like this. For years, the young man was kind and neighbourly towards the old man who lived next door. The old man had been equally kind in return and lived modestly in his humble home. The two men had no qualms, but the young man began to feel unnerved by the old man's eye. One of his eyes was pale blue and with a film over it. Every time the young man felt the unseeing eye fall upon him, his blood ran cold. Over time, the dreadful sensation overwhelmed the young man until he decided that it, and the old man, had to be killed. \n\nThe young man knew that murder was wrong. He knew that the old man was not to blame for his horrible eye, and so was exceedingly kind to him. He did not wish to kill out of passion or madness but instead chose to methodically prepare for the eye's demise. For a week, the young man crept out of his bed at midnight, picked up his lantern and silently slipped into his neighbour's home. He stealthily made his way to the old man's bedroom and inch by inch pushed open the heavy door until he could fit his head inside the opening. Once able, he slowly slid open the sheath to his lantern until a beam of light struck the old man's eye. Night after night, the eye remained closed in sleep; and so the young man swiftly retreated from the room. After all, it was not the man he wanted to kill, but the evil eye. So every morning, the young man would greet the old man at his home with cheery warmth and faux concern about how the old man had slept. Not once did the old man suspect that his young neighbour was entering his bedroom midnight after midnight as the old man slept, awaiting the appearance of the terrible eye.

It's the most common kind of pain relief used during labor. The second stage ends when your baby is born.\n2. What is the best position to be in during the second stage of labor?\nFind a position that is comfortable for you. You can squat, sit, kneel or lie back.\n3. How long are contractions during the second stage of labor?\nYour contractions may slow down to come every 2 to 5 minutes apart. They last about 60 to 90 seconds.\n4. What is an episiotomy?\nYou may get an episiotomy. This is a small cut made at the opening of the vagina to help let the baby out. Most women don't need an episiotomy.\n5. What happens when my baby is crowning?\nCrowing is the term medical professionals use when your baby's head begins to show.\n6. How does the baby exit the birth canal?\nYour provider guides your baby out of the birth canal. She may use special tools, like forceps or suction, to help your baby out.\n7. How does the second stage of labor end?\nYour baby is born, and the umbilical cord is cut. Instructions about who\u2019s cutting the umbilical cord are in your birth plan.", "role": "assistant"}], "category": "Rewrite"}

As a result, the computer was convinced the probe was lower than it actually was, which led to the crash on April 25. \n\n\"While the lander estimated its own altitude to be zero, or on the lunar surface, it was later determined to be at an altitude of approximately 5 kms [3.1 miles] above the lunar surface,\" ispace said in a statement released on Friday (May 26). \"After reaching the scheduled landing time, the lander continued to descend at a low speed until the propulsion system ran out of fuel. At that time, the controlled descent of the lander ceased, and it is believed to have free-fallen to the moon's surface.\"\n\nThe company said in a briefing that an insufficient consideration of terrain topography around the landing side contributed to the failure, partly due to a landing site change several months prior to the mission's liftoff. \n\nThe lander, which launched in December 2022 on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket, was to land on April 26 on the floor of the 54-mile-wide (87 km) Atlas Crater in the Mare Frigoris (\"Sea of Cold\") region of the moon's near side.

This catastrophic event transpired in late April during its landmark landing attempt when the sensor, confused by the lip of a lunar crater, led the lander into a fatal nosedive.\n\nThe spacecraft's creators, the Tokyo-based company ispace, uncovered the harsh reality of this unfortunate event, pinpointing an unanticipated topographical feature as the culprit. The onboard computer of the moon lander, thrown off by the unexpected terrain, had erroneously dismissed the altitude readings. Instead, it relied on a pre-calculated estimate of its altitude relevant to the mission timeline. Consequently, the computer believed the spacecraft was closer to the moon than its actual position, resulting in the disastrous crash on April 25.\n\nAccording to an ispace statement released on Friday (May 26), \"The lander gauged its altitude as zero, interpreting it to be on the lunar surface, only to later establish that it was, in reality, hovering approximately 5 km [3.1 miles] above the lunar surface.\" The descent continued to post the expected landing time until the propulsion system depleted, causing a loss of controlled descent. It's believed to have fallen freely to the moon's surface after that.\n\nIspace acknowledged during a press briefing that a lack of adequate consideration for the surrounding terrain of the landing site factored into the mission's downfall. A late switch in the landing site, just months before the mission's liftoff, was identified as a contributing factor.\n\nThe Hakuto-R, which had launched aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket in December 2022, aimed to touch down in the 54-mile-wide (87 km) Atlas Crater in the moon's Mare Frigoris (\"Sea of Cold\") region. However, a recent sighting by NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter revealed the wreckage of the Hakuto-R near its intended landing site.\n\nThis mission had it has been successful, would have crowned Hakuto-R as the first privately-owned moon lander to achieve a lunar landing. Until now, only NASA, China, and Russia have managed to land spacecraft softly on the moon.\n\nIspace assured that despite this misfortune, the mission managed to fulfill eight out of nine of its objectives. The firm further stated that the unfortunate event would not hamper the scheduled launches of their second and third missions in 2024 and 2025, respectively.", "role": "assistant"}], "category": "Rewrite"}

These periods can last from days to weeks. Mania is a term used to describe really severe happy periods or periods where the person is also seeing and hearing things that aren't actually there. Hypomania is a term used when those periods are less severe. When a person is experiencing mania they may have higher than normal levels of energy, make rash decisions without thinking, and will have trouble falling asleep at night. During depressive periods, a person may have a poor outlook on life and will try to avoid eye contact with others. 6% of individuals with bipolar disorder will die by suicide, while another 30-40% will hurt themselves. Anxiety and substance abuse is also commonly associated with bipolar disorder. \n\nThe causes for these mood episodes are unknown, but genetics and the environment are understood to play a role. Each gene, with its individual small effects, may contribute to the development of bipolar disorder. They account for about 70-90% of the risk of developing the disorder. Long-term stress and childhood abuse are environmental risk factors. Bipolar I disorder is a classification used to describe the disorder if there has been at least one manic episode, with or without depressive episodes. Bipolar II disorder is used if there has been one hypomanic episode and a major depressive episode. Cyclothymia is a term used for classification if there are hypomanic episodes with periods of depression that don't meet the criteria for major depressive episodes. If drugs or other medical problems are causing the symptoms, then the diagnosis cannot be bipolar disorder. Similar conditions to bipolar disorder include schizophrenia, personality disorders, and substance use disorder.

With the first foundational stone expected to be laid in the forthcoming years, Axiom's blueprint of the future features an intriguing alliance with SpaceX. Multiple tourist missions to the International Space Station (ISS) have been agreed upon, with the inaugural journey planned for launch in the closing days of February 2022.\n\nBut these individual projects, impressive as they are, merely form pieces of a grander tapestry. Axiom envisions an expanded human influence beyond the confines of our home planet, in the vast expanse of space.\n\n\"Axiom sees the future as a bustling habitat in the cosmos, fostering breakthroughs and perspectives that advance every person on every corner of the Earth. We're the gatekeepers to low Earth orbit, offering its keys to pioneers, governments, and individuals alike,\" claims the company on their website.\n\nA plethora of esteemed aerospace experts are the architects behind this vision. Among them is Axiom's co-founder, president, and CEO, Mike Suffredini, a seasoned veteran who directed NASA\u2019s ISS program from 2005 to 2015. Another visionary at the helm is co-founder and executive chairman Kam Ghaffarian, who is also known for co-establishing Stinger Ghaffarian Technologies. This contractor is renowned for training NASA astronauts and other personnel involved in the ISS program.\n\nAdding to the stellar lineup are names such as Charlie Bolden, Michael L\u00f3pez-Alegr\u00eda, and Peggy Whitson. Bolden, a former space shuttle commander who spearheaded NASA from 2009 to 2017, serves as a business development consultant. L\u00f3pez-Alegr\u00eda and Whitson, both ex-NASA astronauts, contribute to the venture as the vice president of business development and astronaut consultant, respectively.\n\nTheir blueprint for establishing the commercial space station is methodical. Axiom plans to launch numerous modules to the ISS, eventually having this private infrastructure break free and establish an independent outpost.\n\nThe maiden module is penciled in for a September 2024 lift-off. Three more modules are projected to follow by the close of 2027, conditional on everything going according to the master plan.\n\n\"With the fourth module joining its siblings, Axiom Station will gain the autonomy to part ways from the ISS, metamorphosing into an upgraded, next-gen space station with enhanced crew accommodations, augmented payload capacity, and a devoted manufacturing and research lab module,\" Axiom's chief technology officer Matt Ondler explained to Space.com.\n\nHe anticipates a smooth transition as the timeline coincides with the current planned termination of ISS operations. The goal is to ensure an uninterrupted human presence in LEO.\n\nWhile the ISS is currently green-lit to function until 2024, many anticipate its lifespan to be extended to 2030. President Joe Biden has pledged his support for this extension, though it requires the agreement of other ISS partners such as the European Space Agency, the Canadian Space Agency, the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, and Russia's Roscosmos.\n\nAxiom Station and other commercial stations in LEO could unlock fresh prospects for microgravity research, product development, tourism, and manufacturing, among other activities, according to Ondler.\n\n\"A commercial space station could be a boon for organizations like NASA, allowing them to pursue fundamental space science research and train astronauts for extended lunar missions and Martian journeys without the financial onus of maintaining a LEO station,\" he remarked.", "role": "assistant"}], "category": "Rewrite"}

{"prompt": "Take this article and make it into a brief series of questions and answers. Don't use a bullet point list.\n\nScoliosis\nWhat is Scoliosis?\nEveryone's spine has subtle natural curves. But some people have different curves, side-to-side spinal curves that also twist the spine. This condition is called \"scoliosis\". On an x-ray with a front or rear view of the body, the spine of a person with scoliosis looks more like an \"S\" or a \"C\" than a straight line. These curves can make a person's shoulders or waist appear uneven. These curves can't be corrected simply by learning to stand up straight. You can't cause scoliosis; it does not come from carrying heavy backpacks, participating vigorously in sports, or poor posture.\n\nTypes of Adult Scoliosis\nIn addition to the two types of adult scoliosis discussed in this section\u2014Adult Idiopathic Scoliosis and Adult Degenerative Scoliosis\u2014types of scoliosis that develops early in life or that results from a separate syndrome also effect adults.\n\nAdult Idiopathic Scoliosis\nAdult idiopathic scoliosis is, in essence, a continuation of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis. Sometimes a spine curvature of an idiopathic (cause not known) nature that began during teenage years may progress during adult life. Curves may increase in size 0.5\u00b0 to 2\u00b0 per year. Adolescent curves less than 30\u00b0 are unlikely to progress significantly into adulthood, while those over 50\u00b0 are likely to get bigger, which is why adult scoliosis specialists should monitor the curves over time.\n\nLocations\nOccurs in the thoracic (upper) and lumbar (lower) spine, with the same basic appearance as that in teenagers, such as shoulder asymmetry, a rib hump, or a prominence of the lower back on the side of the curvature. Curves can worsen in the older patient due to disc degeneration and/or sagittal imbalance. Additionally, arthritis commonly affects joints of the spine and leads to the formation of bone spurs.\n\nSymptoms\nAdults with idiopathic scoliosis have more symptoms than teens because of degeneration in discs and joints leading to narrowing of the openings for the spinal sac and nerves (spinal stenosis). Some patients may lean forward to try and open up space for their nerves. Others may lean forward because of loss of their natural curve (lordosis, sway back) in their lumbar spine (low back). The imbalance causes the patients to compensate by bending their hips and knees to try and maintain an upright posture. Adult patients may have a variety of symptoms, which can lead to gradual loss of function:\n\nLow back pain and stiffness are the 2 most common symptoms\nNumbness, cramping, and shooting pain in the legs due to pinched nerves\nFatigue results from strain on the muscles of the lower back and legs\nImaging Evaluation\nScoliosis defined with radiographs that can include the following:\n\nStanding x-ray of the entire spine looking both from the back as well as from the side so your physician can measure the radiographs to determine curve magnitude, measured in degrees using the Cobb method.\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study of the spine is rarely used for patients experiencing minimal symptoms with adult idiopathic scoliosis. An MRI is usually ordered if you have leg pain, your physician finds some subtle neurologic abnormalities on physical examination, or if you have significant pain or an \"atypical\" curve pattern.\n\nTreatment Options\nNonoperative treatment\nThe majority of adults with idiopathic scoliosis do not have disabling symptoms and can be managed with simple measures including the following:\n\nPeriodic observation\nOver-the-counter pain relievers\nExercises aimed at strengthening the core muscles of the abdomen and back and improving flexibility\nBraces, in short-term use for pain relief (long-term use in adults is discouraged because braces can weaken the core muscles)\nEpidurals or nerve block injections for temporary relief if the patient has persistent leg pain and other symptoms due to arthritis and pinched nerves. Patients should track their response to the various injections to help define their pain generators.\nStronger pain medications can also be habit-forming and must be used with caution. If narcotics are needed to control the pain, see a scoliosis surgeon to learn more about the possible causes of pain.\n\nOperative treatment\nSurgical treatment is reserved for patients who have:\n\nFailed all reasonable conservative (non-operative) measures.\nDisabling back and/or leg pain and spinal imbalance.\nSeverely restricted functional activities and substantially reduced overall quality of life.\nThe goals of surgery are to restore spinal balance and reduce pain and discomfort by relieving nerve pressure (decompression) and maintaining corrected alignment by fusing and stabilizing the spinal segments. When patients are carefully chosen and mentally well-prepared for surgery, excellent functional outcomes can be achieved which can provide positive life-changing experience for a given individual patient. When larger surgeries\u2014those greater than 8 hours\u2014are necessary, surgery may be divided into 2 surgeries 5 to 7 days apart. Surgical procedures include:\n\nMicrodecompression relieves pressure on the nerves; A small incision is made and magnification loupes or a microscopic assists the surgeon in guiding tools to the operation site. This type of procedure is typically used only at one vertebra level, and carries a risk of causing the curve to worsen, especially in larger curves >30 degrees.\nSurgical stabilization involves anchoring hooks, wires or screws to the spinal segments and using metal rods to link the anchors together. They stabilize the spine and allow the spine to fuse in the corrected position.\nFusion uses the patient's own bone or using cadaver or synthetic bone substitutes to \"fix\" the spine into a straighter position\nOsteotomy is a procedure in which spinal segments are cut and realigned\nVertebral column resection removes entire vertebral sections prior to realigning the spine and is used when an osteotomy and other operative measures cannot correct the scoliosis.", "prompt_id": "3db3196b195ef3efdda5526caf61fcb00e6c773541cfc190319aa0f257aaab83", "messages": [{"content": "Take this article and make it into a brief series of questions and answers.

Subtle curves in the spine are normal. When different curves are present, like side-to-side curves which also twist the spine, this is the condition called Scoliosis.\n\nWhat are the types of adult scoliosis? Adult Idiopathic Scoliosis and Adult Degenerative Scoliosis. The latter develops later in life and the first one usually early in life. These are two different syndromes of scoliosis.\n\nWhere are the locations of scoliosis? Scoliosis occurs in several locations. Those include the thoracic, upper spine, lumbar, and lower spine. They appear as shoulder asymmetry, a rib hump, or a prominence where the lower back is located in front of the curvature. \n\nWhat causes curves to worsen in older patients? Disc degeneration and/or sagittal imbalance, arthritis which affects joints of the spine. This leads to the formation of bone spurs.\n\nWhat are the symptoms of adult idiopathic scoliosis? Adults have more symptoms than teens because of the degeneration of discs and joints. Because of this, there is a narrowing of the openings for the spinal sac and nerves which is called spinal stenosis. To alleviate this some patients may lean forward in an attempt to open up space for their nerves. Or they man lean forward because of loss of the natural curve in their lumbar spine which is the lower back. As a result of this imbalance, patients compensate by bending their hips and knees trying to hold an upright position. These symptoms can lead to gradual loss of function. Lower back pain. Lower back stiffness. Numbness, shooting pain in the legs, and or cramping. As a result of fatigue, because of the strain on the muscles of the lower back and legs.\n\nWhat sort of imaging evaluation is used? A standing X-ray looks at the entire spine from the back and side. This allows the physician to determine the curve magnitude using the Cobb method. Another type of imaging is an MRI (magnetic resonance imaging). This is rarely used unless the patient has more than minimal symptoms of idiopathic scoliosis. If the patient is having leg pain or subtle neurologic abnormalities noticed during physical examination or if the patient is complaining of significant pain or has an atypical curve pattern.\n\nWhat are the nonoperative treatment options? Periodic observation, over-the-counter pain relievers, exercises to strengthen the core muscles of the back and abdomen as well as stretching for flexibility. Braces are another option but only for short-term pain relief. Long-term usage is not recommended because it weakens the muscles. Epidurals or nerve block injections for temporary relief of leg pain and other symptoms of pinched nerves or arthritis. Narcotics are addicting and should only be used after seeing a scoliosis surgeon to pinpoint the possible causes of the pain.\n\nWhat are the operative treatments? Operative treatments are only recommended for patients who have not seen improvement using nonoperative treatments or have disabling back or leg pain and spinal imbalance. Another reason would be a greatly reduced overall quality of life.

{"prompt": "Take this excerpt and convert it into a quiz with answers.\n\nThe four sons of Horus were a group of four deities in ancient Egyptian religion (Imsety, Hapy, Duamutef, and Qebehsenuef) who were believed to protect deceased people in the afterlife. Beginning in the First Intermediate Period of Egyptian history (c. 2181\u20132055 BC), they were especially connected with the four canopic jars that housed the internal organs that were removed from the body of the deceased during the process of mummification. Most commonly, Imsety protected the liver, Hapy the lungs, Duamutef the stomach, and Qebehsenuef the intestines, but this pattern often varied. The canopic jars were given lids that represented the heads of the sons of Horus. Although they were originally portrayed as humans, in the latter part of the New Kingdom (c. 1550\u20131070 BC) they took on their most distinctive iconography, in which Imsety is portrayed as a human, Hapy as a baboon, Duamutef as a jackal and Qebehsenuef as a falcon.

Beginning in the First Intermediate Period of Egyptian history (c. 2181\u20132055 BC), they were especially connected with the four canopic jars that housed the internal organs that were removed from the body of the deceased during the process of mummification. Most commonly, Imsety protected the liver, Hapy the lungs, Duamutef the stomach, and Qebehsenuef the intestines, but this pattern often varied. The canopic jars were given lids that represented the heads of the sons of Horus. Although they were originally portrayed as humans, in the latter part of the New Kingdom (c. 1550\u20131070 BC) they took on their most distinctive iconography, in which Imsety is portrayed as a human, Hapy as a baboon, Duamutef as a jackal and Qebehsenuef as a falcon.

{"prompt": "Rewrite this text as if it's a narration for a dramatic space documentary.\n\nCapable of both destruction and creation, space volcanoes are common on planets and moons throughout the solar system and beyond.\n\nVolcanoes account for some of Earth's most interesting and violent geographical features, a force for destruction and creation. However, volcanic activity isn't limited to our planet and  space volcanoes are often found on other planets and moons. \n\nWithin our solar system, the moon and Mars are rich with evidence of volcanoes and fiery volcanic activity, while other bodies possess volcanoes that spew ice from their frozen vistas. \n\nVOLCANOES ON THE MOON\nNow volcanically inert, the surface of the moon once hosted spectacular eruptions that created lava flows that extended as far as 750 miles (1,200 kilometers) from their source, according to San Diego State University. \n\nA recent Chinese mission to the lunar surface \u2014 the Chang'e-5 lander \u2014 returned lava that seems to indicate Earth's primary natural satellite was volcanically active more recently than previously believed.\n\nThe sample collected from Oceanus Procellarum on the moon's near side, \u200apreviously associated with recent volcanic activity, suggests volcanism as recently as two billion years ago, a full billion years later than previous estimates.\n\nVOLCANOES ON MARS\nAside from Earth, the planet humanity has studied the geology of most intensely is Mars. This has led to the discovery that the Red Planet is host to even more volcanic features than our planet, according to Arizona State University.\n\nPrimary among these is Olympus Mons, the largest volcano in the entire solar system at twice the height of Mount Everest. It is surrounded by a plethora of other massive volcanoes.\n\nIn addition to this, Mars' other volcanoes includes Elysium, Syrtis Major, and a cluster of low-profile volcanic structures near the Hellas impact basin. This basin is the lowest point on Mars and the third- or fourth-largest known impact crater in the solar system.\n\nMars seems to be volcanically inactive, but when this happened is something astrogeologists are still attempting to figure out. \n\nThe volcanoes in the Tharsis\u200a \u2014 the location of Olympus Mons\u200a \u2014\u200a show few asteroid impact craters, meaning they could be just a few million years old, which is fairly young in geological terms. \n\nMars was clearly very active in its youth, with explosive eruptions petering out as it aged. The planet has no active volcanoes, according to the National Air and Space Museum, and it appears most of the heat once stored in the planet's interior has been lost. \n\nIt is possible we are currently simply seeing Mars in a geologically quiet period and that volcanism could restart on the Red Planet. \n\nVOLCANOES ON OTHER PLANETS\nMany other planets in the solar system have been linked with volcanic activity with most of these having occurred when the solar system was young and violent.\n\nThe closest planet to Earth, Venus, has lava flows that cover up to 90 percent of its surface. Venus has up to 1,600 major volcanoes and could have as many as a million smaller counterparts to these.\n\nWhat isn't certain is if the planet is still volcanically active. Though we have yet to see a volcano erupt on any other planet, Venus is shrouded by thick clouds of sulfuric acid, meaning long-distance observations are difficult. Visiting the planet with a probe is complicated by its intense pressures and temperatures.\n\nImages captured by the MESSENGER mission have shown that Mercury's surface was shaped by volcanic activity. Lava flows on the closest planet to the sun have been dated to be between one and two billion years old. This means that volcanic activity continued well after Mercury formed around 4.5 billion years ago.\n\nFor active volcanoes, one has to look beyond the planets of the solar system to its moons.\n\nVOLCANOES ON MOONS\nAccording to an article by NASA, the most volcanic body in the solar system is Io, one of Jupiter's moons, this activity is caused by the tremendous gravitational influence of the gas giant deforming the tiny moon. \n\nNot only does Io have volcanoes that spew blisteringly hot lava, but the Jovian moon also hosts cryovolcanoes.

However, volcanic activity isn't limited to our planet and  space volcanoes are often found on other planets and moons. \n\nWithin our solar system, the moon and Mars are rich with evidence of volcanoes and fiery volcanic activity, while other bodies possess volcanoes that spew ice from their frozen vistas. \n\nVOLCANOES ON THE MOON\nNow volcanically inert, the surface of the moon once hosted spectacular eruptions that created lava flows that extended as far as 750 miles (1,200 kilometers) from their source, according to San Diego State University. \n\nA recent Chinese mission to the lunar surface \u2014 the Chang'e-5 lander \u2014 returned lava that seems to indicate Earth's primary natural satellite was volcanically active more recently than previously believed.\n\nThe sample collected from Oceanus Procellarum on the moon's near side, \u200apreviously associated with recent volcanic activity, suggests volcanism as recently as two billion years ago, a full billion years later than previous estimates.\n\nVOLCANOES ON MARS\nAside from Earth, the planet humanity has studied the geology of most intensely is Mars. This has led to the discovery that the Red Planet is host to even more volcanic features than our planet, according to Arizona State University.\n\nPrimary among these is Olympus Mons, the largest volcano in the entire solar system at twice the height of Mount Everest. It is surrounded by a plethora of other massive volcanoes.\n\nIn addition to this, Mars' other volcanoes includes Elysium, Syrtis Major, and a cluster of low-profile volcanic structures near the Hellas impact basin. This basin is the lowest point on Mars and the third- or fourth-largest known impact crater in the solar system.\n\nMars seems to be volcanically inactive, but when this happened is something astrogeologists are still attempting to figure out. \n\nThe volcanoes in the Tharsis\u200a \u2014 the location of Olympus Mons\u200a \u2014\u200a show few asteroid impact craters, meaning they could be just a few million years old, which is fairly young in geological terms. \n\nMars was clearly very active in its youth, with explosive eruptions petering out as it aged. The planet has no active volcanoes, according to the National Air and Space Museum, and it appears most of the heat once stored in the planet's interior has been lost. \n\nIt is possible we are currently simply seeing Mars in a geologically quiet period and that volcanism could restart on the Red Planet. \n\nVOLCANOES ON OTHER PLANETS\nMany other planets in the solar system have been linked with volcanic activity with most of these having occurred when the solar system was young and violent.\n\nThe closest planet to Earth, Venus, has lava flows that cover up to 90 percent of its surface. Venus has up to 1,600 major volcanoes and could have as many as a million smaller counterparts to these.\n\nWhat isn't certain is if the planet is still volcanically active. Though we have yet to see a volcano erupt on any other planet, Venus is shrouded by thick clouds of sulfuric acid, meaning long-distance observations are difficult. Visiting the planet with a probe is complicated by its intense pressures and temperatures.\n\nImages captured by the MESSENGER mission have shown that Mercury's surface was shaped by volcanic activity. Lava flows on the closest planet to the sun have been dated to be between one and two billion years old. This means that volcanic activity continued well after Mercury formed around 4.5 billion years ago.\n\nFor active volcanoes, one has to look beyond the planets of the solar system to its moons.\n\nVOLCANOES ON MOONS\nAccording to an article by NASA, the most volcanic body in the solar system is Io, one of Jupiter's moons, this activity is caused by the tremendous gravitational influence of the gas giant deforming the tiny moon. \n\nNot only does Io have volcanoes that spew blisteringly hot lava, but the Jovian moon also hosts cryovolcanoes. These ice volcanoes which occur on planets and moons located away from the sun erupt cold, liquid, or frozen gases like water, ammonia, or methane.\n\nIo is punctuated with hundreds of volcanic vents, many of which blast jets of frozen gas hundreds of miles into Jupiter's atmosphere. \n\nCyrovolcanoes were first observed on one of Neptune's moons, Triton when the Voyager 2 craft caught a glimpse of five mile-high plumes of nitrogen gas during its 1989 flyby of the Neptunian system.\n\nThese eruptions are caused when solar radiation heats nitrogen below Triton's surface, vaporizing it, causing it to expand and eventually erupt from the Neptunian moon's icy surface.

But these molten marvels are not confined to the realm of our world, as space volcanoes dot the terrains of planets and moons far and wide.\n\nOur very own moon and the elusive Mars are littered with relics of past volcanic fury. Meanwhile, some celestial bodies boast volcanoes that eject ice from their frost-covered landscapes.\n\nMOON'S VOLCANIC PAST\nThe lunar surface, which is now volcanically dormant, was once a stage for magnificent volcanic eruptions, birthing lava flows that stretched for an astonishing 750 miles from their origin, as reported by San Diego State University.\n\nThe recent Chang'e-5 lunar mission by China retrieved lava samples that hint at a more recent period of volcanic liveliness on Earth's closest celestial companion than previously assumed.\n\nMARS' VOLCANIC SAGA\nHumanity has examined Mars' geological secrets more than any other celestial body apart from Earth. This deep dive has uncovered the fact that the Red Planet is a treasure trove of more volcanic landmarks than our world.\n\nOlympus Mons, towering at twice the height of Mount Everest, holds the record for the largest volcano in our solar system. Along with this leviathan, Mars is adorned with several other colossal volcanoes.\n\nDespite its volcanic riches, Mars currently seems dormant. The timeline of its volcanic inactivity remains a mystery that astrogeologists strive to unveil.\n\nTHE VOLCANIC COSMOS\nNumerous planets in our cosmic neighborhood bear traces of volcanic activity, a testament to a time when our solar system was young and turbulent.\n\nVenus, Earth's closest planetary neighbor, is a volcanic wonderland with lava flows covering a staggering 90% of its surface. Its surface is pockmarked with up to 1,600 significant volcanoes and potentially millions of smaller ones.\n\nTHE MOON'S VOLCANIC PORTRAIT\nFor an exhibition of active volcanoes, one must turn the gaze away from the planets to the moons of our solar system.\n\nJupiter's moon, Io, bears the distinction of being the most volcanic celestial body in our solar system, as per NASA. Its volcanism is attributed to the immense gravitational pull of the gas giant.\n\nNeptune's moon, Triton, was the stage for the first sighting of cryovolcanoes when Voyager 2 witnessed colossal plumes of nitrogen gas during its 1989 encounter with the Neptunian system.\n\nIn 2005, the Cassini spacecraft captured the spectacle of ice jets emanating from Saturn's moon Enceladus.

It began innocently enough, with the passing of my grandfather and my grandmother's arrival to stay with us for half of every year. Her presence brought an overpowering scent that permeated the air\u2014a scent so potent it could knock out a charging moose. The aroma, emanating from her enigmatic perfume, was stored in a colossal atomizer and liberally sprayed at every opportunity. Venturing into her room meant subjecting oneself to an assault on the senses, gasping for breath in the face of the overwhelming fragrance. Whenever she left to stay with Aunt Lillian, a frantic ritual ensued, involving open windows, stripped bedding, and days dedicated to washing and airing out the rooms in a desperate attempt to banish the lingering odor.\n\nBut it was during an ill-fated lunch at the Biltmore Hotel, a place I deemed the epitome of luxury in my eight-year-old mind, that the nightmare unfolded. Accompanied by my grandmother and mother, I indulged in what I thought was a sophisticated choice\u2014a salisbury steak, a fancy name disguising a humble hamburger smothered in gravy. Alas, the innocent-looking dish arrived with an unwelcome companion\u2014a plate of detestable peas.\n\nPeas, those repulsive green orbs, were my nemesis. I detested them with every fiber of my being. Their slimy texture and bland taste baffled me, leaving me bewildered as to why anyone willingly subjected themselves to such culinary torment. I refused to consume peas at home or in restaurants, and I certainly had no intention of succumbing to them now.\n\n\"Eat your peas,\" my grandmother commanded, her voice carrying an ominous undertone.\n\n\"Mother,\" my mother interjected, her voice a warning. \"He doesn't like peas. Leave him be.\"\n\nMy grandmother remained silent, her eyes glinting with a determined resolve, her jaw set in unwavering determination. Inclining herself toward me, she fixed her gaze upon my own and uttered words that would forever alter the course of my life.\n\n\"I'll pay you five dollars if you eat those peas.\"\n\nAt the time, the impending catastrophe eluded me entirely. All I comprehended was the sheer magnitude of the offer\u2014five dollars, a sum unimaginable to my young mind. The allure of possessing that vast fortune outweighed the wretchedness of the peas. With a mixture of apprehension and greed, I began to force the loathsome legumes down my throat, one after another.\n\nMy mother, livid with anger, directed her glare at both her mother and me. No one could glare like my mother\u2014an Olympic champion in the art of withering stares. The glares unsettled me, each pea causing me to retch internally, but the promise of that coveted five dollars sustained me. And so, with each agonizing bite, I persevered until the last pea disappeared from my plate. My grandmother, triumphant, bestowed upon me the coveted prize, a five-dollar bill presented with a flourish. Meanwhile, my mother's silent glare continued, a testament to her disapproval.\n\nWeeks later, my grandmother departed for Aunt Lillian's. That evening, at the dinner table, a sinister plot unfolded. My mother served two of my all-time favorite dishes\u2014meatloaf and mashed potatoes. But accompanying them, like a steaming bowl of malevolence, were peas\u2014endless, vile peas. She offered me a serving, and in the waning moments of my youthful innocence, I declined. A cold, piercing gaze from my mother accompanied her actions as she piled a mountain of peas onto my plate. And then, the words were spoken, words that would haunt my existence for years to come.\n\n\"You ate them for money,\" she hissed. \"You can eat them for love.\"\n\nDespair consumed me. Devastation washed over my soul. In that moment, the cruel reality sank in\u2014I had unwittingly damned myself to an eternal torment from which there was no escape.\n\n\"You ate them for money. You can eat them for love.\"\n\nWhat defense could I possibly muster against such a damning proclamation? There was none. I ate the peas that day, and every time they were served thereafter. The five dollars evaporated as quickly as it came, and my grandmother, herself, passed away in the following years. Yet, the legacy of the peas endured, a relentless reminder of my capitulation. Even now, if I dare to display the slightest distaste upon their appearance, my mother resurrects the dreadful words, her voice dripping with a sinister tone.\n\n\"You ate them for money,\" she hisses once more. \"You can eat them for love.\"\n\nAnd so, the peas continue to haunt me, an eternal punishment for my youthful folly.", "role": "assistant"}], "category": "Rewrite"}

In my previous articles, I\u2019ve tried to articulate my stance towards legacy vs sunbelt markets, concluding that I don\u2019t see either as significantly positioned. While legacy markets will see lower demand, this will be counter-balanced by lower supply. Sunbelt markets on the other hand, will see some of the highest levels of supply ever, but this will be offset by an influx of people and jobs.

It\u2019s quite simple. Its geographical presence is heavily focused on growing markets in the Sunbelt, with their largest markets being Atlanta (13%), Dallas (10%), and Tampa (7%).

Occupancy is expected to tick up slightly to 95.8% at midpoint. That\u2019s a really positive outlook at a time when the share price, as we\u2019ll see shortly, is very low.

They settle down and create layers of these balls. It takes a very long time, around five million years, for them to stack up to a thickness of one centimeter at a depth of forty meters.

These opals have balls ranging from 150 to 400 nanometers that reflect different colors when light shines on them.\n\nOpal is found in places where there were gaps or empty spaces for it to go. In some rocky areas, it fills only small cracks, while in other places, like sedimentary rocks, there are different kinds of holes made by weathering. Opal can also fill spaces between tiny grains of sand or silt, sticking them together.

Jack asked, \u201cWhat will you give me in return for my cow?\u201d The man answered, \u201cI will give you five magic beans!\u201d Jack took the magic beans and gave the man the cow.

Jack was very sad and went to sleep without dinner.\n\nThe next day, when Jack woke up in the morning and looked out of the window, he saw that a huge beanstalk had grown from his magic beans!

Jack said, \u201cCould you please give me something to eat? I am so hungry!\u201d The kind wife gave him bread and some milk.\n\nWhile he was eating, the giant came home.

We must sell our only cow.\"\n\nDetermined to help his mother, Jack began on his journey to the marketplace. Along the way, a mysterious stranger approached him. The man, who was wearing unusual attire, offered to buy the cow in exchange for five sparkling, iridescent stones. \"These are no ordinary stones,\" the man whispered with a sneaky grin. \"They possess the power to transcend time itself.\"\n\nCuriosity sparked within Jack's heart, and he accepted the intriguing offer. little did he know that these stones were fascinating, capable of opening portals to different eras. When Jack returned home and presented the stones to his mother, she became angry. \"You foolish boy!\" she yelled. \"How could you exchange our cow for trinkets?\" In her anger, she tossed the stones out of the window, dismissing them as worthless.\n\nFeeling rejected and hungry, Jack went to bed without dinner. But as the night made its way to dawn, an extraordinary sight greeted him. Outside his window, a large beanstalk had sprouted from the same spot the stones had fallen to. It reached high heavens, going through the clouds and disappearing from sight. Jack's heart raced with excitement and the hope of adventure.\n\nDriven by his uncontrollable curiosity, Jack began to climb the tall beanstalk. With each step that he took, he felt as if he was traveling through time, leaving the ordinary world. Finally, he entered a wondrous kingdom floating amidst the sky, an era far from his own.\n\nIn the exquisite realm, he stumbled upon a huge castle, that a gigantic couple called home. It was a formidable giant and his wife. Despite his fright, Jack managed to enter the castle unnoticed. There, he encountered the giant's wife in the kitchen and he had the nerve to ask for some food. overwhelmed with compassion, the kind-hearted woman offered him bread and milk, satisfying his hunger.\n\nHowever, Jack's intermission was short, due to the giant returning home, and casting a shadow of terror upon him.

Once again, the giant ate his meal and went to his quarters once more.\n\nUnbeknownst to the giant, within steps from his room lay a mystical hen with radiant feathers. On the giant command, the hen would produce a golden egg- a source of unmeasurable wealth.

A boy is stealing me!\" Startled awake, the giant spotted Jack clutching the coveted harp. The giant then thundered after Jack.

Astra gave Nova intelligence beyond measure, Celestia gave her a voice that could harmonize with the cosmos, and Lyra was about to give her a gift when Malvora, a malevolent sorceress, emerged from the depths of the galaxy. Consumed by jealousy at not being invited, Malvora placed a curse on Nova, declaring that she would flourish in brilliance and charm, but before her sixteenth cycle around the sun was complete, she would succumb to eternal stasis.\n\nLyra, aware that her powers were not potent enough to undo the curse, channeled her magic to weaken the spell, altering Nova's fate to a deep slumber, breakable only by the power of true love's embrace.

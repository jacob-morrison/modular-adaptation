Perhaps there are even different grades of poison, depending on how lethal you want it to be. The vials always break when they are shot at something, and if the poison is acidic enough, can melt into whatever they are shot at.

Tell an anecdote - Once you have someone's attention, tell a funny or amusing story.

Play a game - Always sure to get a party started and encourage mixing and mingling among partygoers, playing a game can be entertaining and will give you a chance to get to know others in a fun setting. Play a physical game like Twister or Charades, card games like Poker or Hearts, or board games like Monopoly.\n5. Show off some interesting pictures - People love looking at photos and getting to know what others look like in candid situations.

It's important to note that costs will differ based on location!\n\n1. Canola Oil\nYou wouldn't eat canola oil alone, but that's why it's great for weight gain. You can easily add it to other meals and boost your calorie intake with little effort. With 240 calories in 2 tbsp of canola oil, it certainly packs a punch. Canola oil is comparatively really cheap, also. You can usually buy a gallon for around $10. \n\nCanola oil is pretty versatile as well in terms of how you can get it into your diet. You can drizzle it on salads, fry things, or baste your meat with it. There is no shortage of ways to easily add calories when you use canola oil. \n\n2. Potatoes\nPotatoes are perfect for gaining weight. High in carbs, high in calories, found everywhere, and pretty cheap, too. There are many ways to cook potatoes and have them as the main ingredient or the side of a dish. In terms of calories per dollar, potatoes are very competitive, with a pound of potatoes costing around $1. Not as cheap as canola oil, but potatoes are also far easier to have a lot of, especially when butter is added. \n\nPotatoes can be added to so many dishes. Making up a bulk of mashed potatoes and eating them as a snack is pretty easy. They can be boiled, mashed, baked, stewed, or fried when cooking.\n\n3. White Rice\nWhite rice has been a high-calorie food used worldwide for a long time. Rice can be found everywhere. It's extremely cheap, and best of all, it can be the base of so many great-tasting dishes or even just added as a side to many others. Rice has a staggering 2,860 calories per roughly $1 when you buy in bulk, which is a great price.\n\nRice can be used as the base of curries, added to soups and stews, go in tacos, burritos, and so much more. Rice is easy to cook and can be stored in the fridge for leftovers.\n\n4. Pancake Batter\nWhy not start your day with a high-calorie-dense breakfast that leaves you wanting to eat more throughout the day? Pancake batter is delicious, cheap, and high in calories. A 2lb box of pancake mix will cost somewhere around $2 and give you over 2,000 calories on its own, but when you add butter, milk, and syrup, you'll get an even higher calorie content.\n\nYou can also use pancake batter to make other things, such as muffins. \n\n5. Whole Chicken\nWhole chickens are incredible for calories and are usually in every major grocery store for bargain prices. These usually come pre-cooked, too, meaning you won't have to worry. You can buy a whole chicken cooked for $4.99 at Costco. That chicken should provide you with over 3,250 calories. That equals 650 calories a dollar. \n\nChicken isn't the best on the list for calories per dollar but it's probably the best for versatility and ease of cooking. Consider trying a rice meal with chicken to get an easy high, calorie meal. ", "role": "assistant"}], "category": "Brainstorm"}

The ideal trekking season for this mountain is from spring to autumn, and climbers should be aware of the changing weather conditions throughout the year.\u00a0\n\n2. Hochschwab, Austria - The mountains of Northern Styria are filled with alpine huts that facilitate multi-day hikes, giving you a welcoming overnight stay as you climb to the top.

Brave beginners can often take on the entire climb in a day, while others may prefer to take their time and camp out overnight. The best time to climb Mount Anne is between November and May. This is when the area has the best weather for climbing.\u00a0\n\n6. Snowdon, Wales\u00a0\nIf you are looking for a mountain climbing experience that the entire family can enjoy, Snowdon Mountain in Wales is excellent for climbing with kids. The mountain is associated with the legends of King Arthur, the fabled king is said to have killed a fearsome giant who once lived on the mountain and is reputedly still buried at the summit. While it is possible to trek Snowden Mountain throughout the year, the railway closes down during the winter.\u00a0\n\n7. Alvand Kuh, Iran - Ideal for cultural exchange, the mountain of Alvand Kuh is a good choice for beginners. It is one of the most popular peaks in western Iran for climbing or hiking and for good reason. The trek to the top may be completed in one day, but it can be fun to stay overnight with the locals at one of the mountain shelters along the way. The best time to trek this mountain is between spring and fall. If you have concerns about losing your way, it is a good idea to climb during the weekend so that you will be around other local hikers who will help you find your way to the top.\u00a0", "role": "assistant"}], "category": "Brainstorm"}

The target audience is people who are writing fiction novels rather than shorter projects or nonfiction works.", "role": "user"}, {"content": "Sure, I can help with that. Here are some things to do when you're struggling with writer's block:\n\n1. Take a walk. Sometimes, getting your blood flowing and your heart pumping can serve to awaken new creative impulses in the brain. Bring a smartphone or notepad on your walk so you can jot down any ideas that come to mind while you're on the go. You may find it helpful to listen to music as you walk or do some pointed people-watching for inspiration.\n2. Re-read your work. Sometimes, writer's block can be a symptom of feeling exhausted and discouraged. Writing a novel is a long and difficult undertaking, so while you're in the messy middle and yet to reap any of the rewards that come with a finished product, you may need to go back and re-read some of your earlier work to remind yourself how far you've come, feel proud of your progress, and get a better feel for the established pacing of your story. \n3. Focus on outlines and planning. Writer's block isn't always a sign of creative burnout. Sometimes it's difficult to write what comes next because you don't really know where your story is going. You can use your time to focus on making a detailed outline that functions as a map, telling you exactly where to go next in your book. Alternatively, you could focus on drafting character or place names, fleshing out character profiles, solidifying worldbuilding elements, or any other practical logistics that need to be in place to make the world of your story feel real to readers. \n4. Read a book by another author. There are two strategies you could take here. First, you could opt to read something by an author whose work inspires you to grow as an author, perhaps an author who does an exemplary job with some of your favorite aspects of fiction writing. On the flip side, though, great authors can sometimes serve to intimidate or discourage authors who are working on rough drafts, so you might prefer instead of pick up a book that is noticeably flawed. Reading a \"bad\" book can sometimes inspire writers by giving them confidence in their own abilities and demonstrating that perfectionism is not necessarily the key to getting published. \n5. Talk to other writers. Writer's block happens to the best of us, and sometimes it can be helpful just to voice your concerns and frustrations out loud to someone who understands what you're struggling with. Other writers may also have suggestions that can help get you unstuck in your creative process. \n6. Skip ahead to an exciting scene. If you're feeling stuck where you are, then go ahead and skip ahead to an upcoming scene that you're more excited about writing. Often, doing so will help to make it easier to fill in the blanks between what you've already written and the future scene you're excited about because when the future scene is fully fleshed out, it will be easier to determine what needs to happen in the plot to connect point A to point B. \n7. Focus on editing. Sometimes it's hard to know where your story is going next because the earlier plot points you've written have backed you into a corner. Or, alternatively, maybe the parts of the story you've already written have left you with too many options for paths leading forward, an overabundance of Chekhov's guns and red herrings, too many characters, or an overly complicated story arc. It may be helpful to backtrack and edit the beginning of the story so that you can see a simpler trail leading from beginning to end.", "role": "assistant"}], "category": "Brainstorm"}

They are perfect for entertaining because they can be scaled up or down. You can mix up the presentation by assembling this dessert in small highball glasses or mason jars, which are perfect for exact portioning. \n2. No-Bake Peanut Butter Bars. These bars can be made with most ingredients you'd already find in your pantry. Salted butter, peanut butter, powdered sugar, vanilla wafers, and semi-sweet chocolate come together to make these decadent bars that guests will be sure to love. These bars only need to be cooled in the fridge for 1 hour before they can be cut into individual bars for portioned servings. If peanut allergies are a concern, some great alternatives are seed butter or other kinds of nut butter. The flavors will be similar.\n3. Individual Key Lime Pies. Made with lime custard, graham cracker crust, and whipped cream, these will be sure to please your guests. In small individual serving dishes, flatten the graham cracker crust in the bottom, top with the key lime custard, and finish it with the whipped cream. Chill in the fridge until dessert is ready to be served.\n4. Rice Krispie Treats. This is a classic dessert that will remind guests of their childhood. Marshmallow and rice krispie cereal mix together to form this all-original favorite. Combine the ingredients with salt and vanilla extract and form the mixture in a pan while hot. Let it sit at room temperature before cutting the rice krispie treats into individual squares. Separate the squares with wax paper so they do not stick together and are easy for guests to grab.\n5. No-Bake Chocolate Oatmeal Cookies. A No-Bake interpretation of the classic chocolate chip oatmeal cookie. These cookies are made with brown sugar, cocoa powder, unsalted butter, almond butter, rolled oats, and chocolate chips. Simply combine all ingredients in a bowl and use an ice cream scooper to form them on a baking sheet, slightly flattening them into cookie shapes. Place in the freezer for 1 hour to set.

Can you write up some tips for starting to stream on the Twitch platform?", "role": "user"}, {"content": "Here are some tips for getting started as an online streamer:\n\n1. Have good hardware - A good microphone is a must-have for any streamer. Most people are tuning in to hear you speak so having a decent microphone is important. A quality web camera doesn't have to cost a lot of money but will also improve your stream.\n2. Create a HUD - You want to make a stream that stands out, and something that helps it stand out is a HUD. A HUD is a digital overlay, and it includes factors like a border around the webcam screen and pop-ups when people donate and follow. You can implement a HUD into streaming software such as OBS and xSplit. \n3. Find what people watch that isn't commonly streamed - Popularly streamed games may not attract as many viewers, as there is more competition. When you get started, you can boost your view count by finding a niche that isn't streamed much but is viewed frequently. You can find these games by going to the games list on Twitch and skipping the first 20 games or so. After you pass these games, you can look for something you like. If more than thirty people are streaming a game, it helps to find a game with fewer streamers. This works, because it gives you a better chance of landing on the front page of a particular game.\n4. Talk to someone while you stream - As you get started, no one will be watching. The reason this may be detrimental is you may not be talking much, which may cause some people to leave the stream. If you have someone else to talk to, the blank space will be filled with conversation.\n5. Be consistent and persistent - Try to put together a schedule for your streams, as more people will likely watch if it's at a set time. Also, remember that not all streams go well, and there can be tons of things that go wrong. Even if this happens, keep going, and eventually you'll find your footing.", "role": "assistant"}], "category": "Brainstorm"}

English Springer Spaniel. Originally bred as hunters, these dogs are people pleasers, highly trainable, and very social. They don't enjoy being left home alone often, but they thrive when they receive attention and can spend quality time with their owners. They usually weigh around 40 to 50 pounds and have a medium-length coat that comes in a variety of colors.\n2. Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retriever. These pups look like they could be Golden Retriever's little brothers. They have red coats and usually weigh-in somewhere between 30-50 pounds. They enjoy being active and love swimming, and due to their retrieving background, they respond well to training. \n3. Whippet. Slender dogs that look like smaller versions of Greyhounds, Whippets are incredibly fast and need exercise every day. In between their energetic bursts, however, they are couch potatoes who love to snuggle with their owners. Their coloring is brindle and thanks to their short coat, they're very low-maintenance when it comes to grooming. They are very affectionate and content dogs. \n4. Australian Shepherd. When they get enough exercise, Australian Shepherds are great dogs that are low-key and easy to train. If they're neglected and cooped up too much, on the other hand, all of that extra energy gets channeled into destructive behaviors, like chewing and barking. They have thick coats that require regular brushing and grooming. \n5. Australian Cattle Dog. Often known as Blue Heelers, these powerful yet compact dogs need plenty of exercise. They love to explore and are incredibly energetic. They also tend to be very healthy dogs, so you shouldn't expect too many vet visits.

According to research, lesser options for customers can lead to increased sales as customers are more likely to decide on a product and purchase it.\n\n2. Offer a loyalty program as it can make customers feel happier and increase their loyalty towards your store. Additionally, retailers gain valuable insights into customers' preferences with such programs.\n\n3. Make rewards accessible and attainable, leveraging the human psyche's motivation to reach a goal. By making customers feel they are already close to obtaining a reward, they are more inclined to make purchases.\n\n4. Use emotional triggers to influence purchasing decisions; nostalgia and greed are particularly effective. Use in-store atmospheres that evoke memories and emotions through music and visuals to help customers feel more connected to products.\n\n5. Highlight popular items to attract more customers through the power of social proof. When customers see others purchasing a product, it creates a subconscious desire to follow suit.\n\n6. Personalize the shopping experience to make it more relevant to customers. Using a customer's name or interests, for example, is more likely to facilitate a purchase.\n\n7. Snobbish behavior in high-end stores can increase sales as customers aspire to be part of an exclusive group.

Cut down on your grocery bill - Most people when they start calculating a budget are very shocked to find out how much money they spend on groceries every month. The average American family of four tends to spend around $966 per month. It can be easy to fill the cart with a few extra treats for yourself, but all those small extras will add up to a very big total after a while. To help save money on groceries, you can try planning out your meals every week and take a good look at what you already have on hand before you shop. Another way to cut down on your grocery costs is to shop solo and leave the kids at home. \n\n2. Cancel Your Automatic Subscriptions and Memberships - There's a good possibility that you are paying for several subscription services that you aren't using. Trendy subscription boxes, Amazon Prime, and various streaming services may not cost much on their own but they do add up quickly. Be sure to turn off auto-renew on the services you use so that you will not have a recurring charge every month. \n\n3. Buy Generic - One of the simplest ways to save money is to stop buying brand-name items. In most cases, the only thing better about buying brand names is the advertising and packaging. Everything from food to cleaning supplies and paper products will have a generic alternative that you can try and you may find you like those products just as much if not more than the pricier name brand.

An athame - This is a ritual blade that witches often use to represent the physical manifestation and direction of their intention; it doesn\u2019t need to be used to cut anything so many witches keep the blade dulled. This item is considered highly personal so while the classic style of an athame is a silver blade with a black leather hilt, you can choose whatever style or color resonates best with your personal style. \n2. Crystals - Various types of crystals all hold their own metaphysical meanings, some of which will be more relevant to your needs than others. But generally, clear crystals are believed to function as amplifiers that strengthen the power of most spells and can serve as substitutes for most other crystal types in a pinch. \n3. Candles - Countless spells call for the lighting of a candle to initiate the casting. Candles can also serve to represent the element of fire on your altar. \n4. A mortar and pestle - This tool is especially handy for grinding herbs and mixing ingredients for spells. \n5. A chalice, goblet, or small bowl - Often, spells will call for a vessel to contain water or another liquid, which may or may not be consumed during the casting. \n6. Glass jars with lids - Many spells will prompt you to mix ingredients together in a clear vessel and then store the mixture somewhere. You'll want to have some airtight glass jars handy for your castings. These can also be used to collect moon-charged water. \n7. A set of kitchen spices - It may be a bit pricier to buy herbs and spices in sets, but luckily this is a purchase you can multitask with. Lots of herbs and spices commonly used for cooking can also be incorporated into spellcasting, so you can be sure this set won't go to waste. Oth\n8. Broom - It's not just a stereotype. Wiccans often use brooms for ritual cleansing before or after spellcasting. \n9. A totem, statue, or figurine - You can choose which representation of the divine, if any, you prefer to worship. Many Wiccans decorate their alters with small statues or other items that remind them of the deity or spirit that inspires them most. \n10. A grimoire - Also called a \"Book of Shadows,\" Wiccans buy or craft blank journals in which they can record their experiences with spellcasting, alongside notes, ideas, plans, and anything else that inspires them.

Here are some ways in which the Fourth Amendment governs how police conduct investigations while protecting individual rights:\n\n1. The Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution protects all citizens from unreasonable searches and seizures of their persons and their property, unless by a search and seizure warrant, and only if the warrant details the probable cause of the search or seizure, the person or things to be seized, and the locations where these things will be found.\n2. Probable cause is the legal standard that police officers must adhere to when seizing (arresting) a person or searching a person, place, or thing. Probable cause is defined as that which would cause a reasonable person to believe that a crime has been, is being, or will be committed and that the person being seized is the one who committed the crime, or that the place or thing being searched contain fruits of the crime (i.e. evidence).\n3. When an officer has probable cause to seize a person, place, or thing or search said person, place, or thing, they will draft a search warrant that will be reviewed by a judge and filed with the court of jurisdiction where the crime took place.\n4. Sometimes exceptions to the search warrant rule will still warrant a seizure or search if the exception has been previously recognized by the courts through a previous ruling, and when requiring a search or seizure warrant would have put an excessive burden on the police to prevent the death or injury of another person, property damage, or the destruction of evidence. Examples of this include the exigent circumstance exception (police not searching or seizing immediately would result in someone getting killed or hurt, such as arresting a person without a warrant as they are in the process of attempting to kill someone), or plain view exception (a police officer sees a person attempting to flush drugs down a toilet in their residence, so a search warrant may not be needed to enter the home and retrieve the drugs before they are destroyed.)\n\nThese are just some examples of how the intricacies of the Fourth Amendment play a significant role in how police officers conduct business.", "role": "assistant"}], "category": "Brainstorm"}

Each idea contains a brief description of that destination and an explanation of why it is suitable based on your tastes. The answers are formatted in a numbered list:\n\n1. Frenchmen Street. A less touristy and more authentic New Orleans experience, Frenchmen Street has live music (especially jazz), bars, restaurants, nightclubs, and art galleries. This destination should suit you based on your interests in live music and art galleries.\n2. French Quarter. This neighborhood is the heart and soul of New Orleans as well as a National Historic Landmark. The site of the original New Orleans colony established in 1718 by the French, this area retains much of its original charm with French street names, narrow cobblestone streets, and various historic attractions. The French Quarter is a suitable choice based on your interest in historic locations. \n3. National WWII Museum. The museum has an array of artifacts and educational films covering all aspects of World War II. One of the most interesting features is the oral recantations of both civilian and soldier experiences during the early 1940s.

All it takes is freshly brewed espresso, coffee liqueur, and vodka. \n\n- Irish coffee: You can make this from scratch, or you can just mix Bailey\u2019s Irish cream into any coffee beverage, hot or iced. \n\n- Coffee cake: This cake is a classic coffee-flavored sweet thought to go well with coffee or tea. \n\n- Tiramisu: Similar to coffee cake, tiramisu is a classic dessert that comes to mind when thinking of coffee-flavored desserts. \n\n- Chocolate cake: Many classic chocolate cake recipes mix coffee into the batter or replace water with coffee to add an extra richness to the flavor profile. \n\n- Coffee-flavored waffles: To get the flavor for this one, you\u2019ll need espresso powder to mix into the batter, and perhaps more to sprinkle on top of the finished product.\n\n- Coffee ice cream: If you have an ice cream maker, all you really need is instant coffee, sweetened condensed milk, and cream to create coffee-flavored ice cream.\n\n- Coffee-rubbed steak: Ground coffee beans combined with some of your favorite seasonings and spices make an excellent rub for a steak. \n\n- Bourbon and maple sweet potatoes: For this one, you\u2019ll roast the sweet potatoes and then a coffee reduction is utilized in a delicious sauce mixed with syrup and bourbon.\n\n- Pulled pork: If cooking this in the slow cooker, you can add a bit of brewed coffee to really enhance the flavors and leave behind a scrumptious gravy. \n\n- Bacon jam: Wherever you want to use this jam is up to you, but the bacon flavor mixed with coffee and bourbon (amongst other ingredients) is a surefire way to mix up any cheese board or sandwich. \n\n- Salted honey and chocolate bark: This one may require a bit of extra work, but this sweet and salty candy is a delicious use of crushed coffee beans.

The object of the game is to be the first team to reach a certain number of points, and you win these points by grabbing tricks. \n\n- Spades. This game is often played with two teams of two, but it can also be played with just two players. During each hand, players estimate how many tricks they think they can take with the hand they've been dealt - keeping in mind that spades are wildcards. Get ready to wager against your opponents!\n\n- Oh Pshaw. This game doesn't require partners, so it can be played by three to seven players. Each consecutive hand will have more cards as cards are progressively dealt as the game goes on. The trump card is important and changes every round. This is a lively game that will keep you on your toes!\n\n- Pitch. This is another single-player game that can be played with three to seven players, but it can be adapted to play with two teams of two.

With consideration to your band's genre and theme of music, here are some band names that use each of those special characters: !@#$%^&*\n\n1) Dr!nkn'\nThis name is a play on words for one of the popular themes in country music: drinking. The exclamation point also represents the surprise and excitement of drinking with your friends. In terms of art, the exclamation point may also symbolize someone on their head, upside down, symbolizing the wacky adventures that may proceed during a night of drinking.\n\n2) @L@B@M@\nThis name substitutes all the letter A's in the word \"Alabama\", with the special character, \"@\". Having multiple instances of this special character may create a neat illusion of the band's name swirling and spinning.\n\n3) NeedleInA#\nThis name mimics the common saying of, \"looking for a needle in a haystack\". The word \"needle\" is a double entendre and may refer to an actual needle of a record player or a physical needle, while the word \"haystack\" was replaced with the special character \"#\", loosely resembling a compressed haystack. Haystacks are also commonly found on farms and in barns.\n\n4) $outh$wamp\nWith many southern states in America having swamps as part of their geographic terrain, this band name references that landscape while replacing the letter S's in \"SouthSwamp\", with the special character, \"$\". The special character also may resemble a slithering snake, an animal commonly found in swamplands.\n\n5) 100%Hennessey\nSimilar to the band name Dr!nkn', this name references Hennessey, an alcoholic brandy popular in the South. The \"100%\" portrays a complete and focused dedication to having fun, going all out, and drinking with friends, which are themes in some popular country music songs.\n\n6) Sun^Overalls^\nThis band name interprets the phrase \"Sun's up, overall's up\", meaning that at sunrise, a farmer would pull up and wear their overalls to begin their day on the farm. The word \"up\" was replaced with the special character, \"^\", symbolizing an up direction pointing north, thus creating the band name, Sun^Overall^.\n\n7) Moon&Shine\nSimilar to Dr!nkn' and 100%Hennessey, this band name references moonshine, a high-proof whiskey, traditionally made illegally, especially in the South where it continues to remain popular. This band name bifurcates the word \"moonshine\" into two independent words, moon, and shine, reattached with the special character, \"&\", and pronounced simply: moonshine.\n\n8) Southern*\nThis band name takes the name \"Southern Star\" and replaces the word \"Star\" with the special character, \"*\", resembling a star in the night sky. Although Southern Star is not intentionally referencing anything in particular, the stresses on the consonants make the pronunciation of this band name easy and fun to say, with intentional stress placed on the \"S\" letters in this band name.", "role": "assistant"}], "category": "Brainstorm"}

These normally shy animals are hard to spot but they can be lured out of their dens and their burrows with food. Save some of your food from dinner and place it somewhat away from the campfire. Animals are quick to sniff out a meal and will gladly follow the scent back to camp. Stay quiet and be patient and you may get some great pictures of a desert fox up close!\n\nSurf the Dunes\nDesert dunes not only look like water waves but can be surfed as well. Decide whether you want to ski, surf or snowboard down the dune then grab your board and walk up to the top. The ride down a steep dune is fast and matches the fun of surfing on a wave. You can stand up on the board or sit down and enjoy the ride. You'll want to bring your own board or rent one before setting out to the dunes. And remember to bring your hat, sunglasses, sunscreen and plenty of water to drink. Deserts are hot!\n\nSpa Break Desert Style\nIf you're tired and sore from sand surfing and camping, you can find relief in a sand bath. Akin to the mud baths found in day spas, sand baths are said to ease aches and pains and restore your peace of mind. At the small village of Merzouga, which is near the Moroccan-Algerian border, you can join the locals in an early morning sand bath. After digging a hole in one of the dunes, you lie covered in sand and watch the beautiful sunrise for a maximum of 30 minutes. \n\nWatch the Stars\nIt's quiet out in the desert. Deafeningly so. It's also inky dark so the stars shine brightly in the night sky. There's no light pollution to interfere with the view or traffic noise to bombard your ears. Just watch as dusk gives way to night and the stars take center stage. In addition to stars, you can see planets and identify constellations. Downloading a  star-gazing app is a great way to identify what you're seeing in the night sky. ", "role": "assistant"}], "category": "Brainstorm"}

Thank you!", "role": "user"}, {"content": "I'm sorry to hear about your father's passing, but it's wonderful you want to do something special with his ashes. Here are 6 ideas:\n\n1. Scattering: Scattering ashes is a very popular way to commemorate your loved one. If he had a favorite place or somewhere the two of you enjoyed spending time together, you could scatter them there. It may bring you comfort to know he is somewhere he loved dearly. Of course, you should always check the regulations and rules concerning the disposal of human remains in your chosen location before you go ahead with this decision.\n2. Jewelry: Many people opt to wear jewelry containing the ashes of their loved ones to feel close to them, such as rings or necklaces. There are many options to choose from to suit your style and taste. You can buy a pendant necklace with a hollowed-out center and funnel a small pinch of his ashes inside, or you can have a piece custom-made to incorporate the ashes right into the metal. Some companies even make it possible to convert ashes into a man-made diamond, which you can then have placed in any setting you prefer. To add a personal touch, you can get the jewelry piece engraved, perhaps with your loved one's name or a sentimental saying.\n3. Trees: For lovers of nature, this is a wonderful way to use their ashes. The remains are planted in a biodegradable urn along with soil and a sapling which are then planted in the ground. Over time, the tree absorbs nutrients from the ashes as it grows, which means the ashes will forever become a part of the tree.\n4. Fireworks: For someone outgoing with a bright and bubbly personality, fireworks would make the perfect send-off. Some companies make fireworks that incorporate ashes so you can have an unforgettable and beautiful fireworks display to remember your loved one with.\n5. Ashes tattoo: For fans of body art, this is a unique and permanent way to commemorate a loved one. For this process, some of the ashes would be mixed with tattoo ink and used to complete the tattoo as normal. The design of the tattoo is up to you, but some wonderful commemorative tattoo ideas include a portrait of your loved one, lyrics to their favorite song, a beloved phrase or saying of theirs, or their name. It is worth noting that this isn't a standard request and not all tattoo artists would be willing to perform such a task. You should take your time to research artists who have significant experience with this style of tattoo.\n6. Vinyl: If your loved one was a huge music fan, this is the ultimate way to commemorate them. The ashes of your loved one can be pressed into a vinyl record with the audio of your choice. It will look and play just like a standard record. You can use their favorite song or even a recording of their voice if you have one.", "role": "assistant"}], "category": "Brainstorm"}

Here are 5 ways you can accomplish this:\n\n1. Use mirrors - Mirrors give a perception of depth to a room, making it appear larger than it truly is. Consider putting up a mirror or two in strategic places in your room that fit in with your overall design.\n2. Plants - Houseplants (either real or fake) can add a certain level of charm and a tropical feel to your room. Put a houseplant in an open corner of the room or hang it from the ceiling. Bonus points for fake plants, as upkeep is minimal since they do not need to be watered.\n3. Accessories with dual purposes - To keep clutter to a minimum, use furniture that can have dual purposes. For instance, having a nightstand with drawers near your bed can act as a table for you to put a lamp on as well as a storage area for small things like books or other knickknacks that would otherwise go on the top of the nightstand and clutter that area. Or, use rolling storage bins that can fit under your bed to store excess clothing and other items to free up much-needed space in your closet.\n4. Make use of lighting - Use lighting to set the mood in your room. Soft lighting can add a sense of intimacy, while bright lights can cause you to feel alert and active. You could use color-changing lights that can do both types of lighting, or you can have dedicated lighting (such as LED light strips) as accents in certain areas of your room.\n5. Put up pictures - Consider decorating your empty walls with still-life pictures or paintings. Having an empty wall can make a room feel less cozy, but putting up some pictures will give you something to look at.", "role": "assistant"}], "category": "Brainstorm"}

Here are five active dog breeds you might want to consider:\n\n1. Australian Shepherd: The Australian Shepherd is an active herding breed that comes in a variety of colors, including merle. They have lots of energy and few health problems genetically, which make them great hiking companions and give them a chance at a long life. However, they can be very vocal and struggle with separation anxiety, so it's important to get a handle on training early.\n2. Border Collie: The Border Collie is one of the most famous working dogs in the world and is very active. However, as they are used to having a job, you will need to provide lots of enrichment and stimulation, or your dog might become bored.\n3. Poodle: The Poodle is a hunting dog favored by many due to its dense coat that doesn't shed much, making it ideal for people with allergies. However, as Poodles are highly intelligent, they need to have a lot to do, or they can also become destructive and vocal.\n4. Husky: The Husky is a breed with tons of energy which means that if you need a buddy to join you on long weeks, they can be ideal. However, they're very vocal and escape artists. If you don't have at least a six-foot privacy fence, you'll be unable to leave your dog unattended in the backyard, as it might run off\u2014especially if it isn't getting enough exercise.\n5. Corgi: For something a little smaller, you can look at a Corgi. People often overlook this breed because of its short stubby legs, but as they were bred for herding, they're highly energetic and playful, which makes them great companions. However, they can be stubborn to train.\n\nIt's important to do your own research before deciding on a breed so you know which one is best for you.", "role": "assistant"}], "category": "Brainstorm"}

Vitamin A is beneficial for night vision. Additionally, they also contain vitamin K, vitamin C, potassium, and a reasonable amount of fiber.   \n\n2) Broccoli - Broccoli is loaded with vitamins A, C and K.  In addition, the phytochemical sulforaphane is in broccoli, which may help to prevent certain types of cancer.  On top of all of that, it contains lutein, beta-carotene and zeaxanthin, which may decrease the risk of age-related macular degeneration.  Given the cancer-preventing properties, this has to be on the list.\n\n3) Mushrooms - Mushrooms are rich in B vitamins, niacin, riboflavin and pantothenic acid.  These help in the formation of red blood cells, aiding digestion and maintaining healthy skin.  The bioactive compounds in mushrooms may also help with cognition, heart health, and disease prevention.  \n\n4) Kale - Kale contains a variety of vitamins like A, B6, and K.  It also has several minerals like potassium, calcium, copper and magnesium.  This puts it by numbers alone, above most other vegetables.

Lap Pool: Lap pools are specifically designed for swimming laps and exercise. They're long and narrow, allowing swimmers to swim continuously without interruptions. Lap pools can be either inground or above ground, and they usually have a consistent depth throughout the pool.\n5. Swim Spa: A swim spa is a combination of a small pool and a spa. It features a powerful current that allows you to swim in place, providing the benefits of swimming and hydrotherapy.

Frankenstein's Monster Crispy Rice Treats: This is a fun dessert that is easy to make and doesn't require the use of an oven. First, make up a batch of crispy rice treats by melting butter and marshmallows on the stovetop. Once melted, add some crisped rice cereal and green food coloring, then stir to combine. Leave to set in a rectangular pan, then cut into uniform rectangle shapes. Take some melted dark or milk chocolate, and dip the top part of the treat into the chocolate to resemble hair. Add edible candy eyeballs for the eyes, and use black icing to pipe on a smile and some scars. To make the recipe gluten-free, ensure that the rice cereal you're using is a gluten-free variety. \n2. Mummified Cookies: These cute cookies are easy to make. Take a sugar cookie, either store-bought or homemade. Make a simple frosting of powdered sugar, vanilla extract, and milk (no food coloring needed) and pipe it onto the cooled cookies in a zig-zag motion. Use candy eyeballs or black icing for eyes. Bake your sugar cookies at home using gluten-free flour to make the recipe gluten-free.\n3. Monster Cake Pops: Make some cake pops using whichever cake flavor you'd like (or use multiple flavors). Once they have cooled completely, melt some white candy melts or white chocolate at a low temperature. Separate them into bowls and add different food coloring to each bowl (you can use whichever colors you'd prefer, but colors such as bright blue, green, or orange would be great for these pops) and coat the cake pops in the coating. Once the coating has set, decorate them with candy eyes and Halloween sprinkles. To make the recipe gluten-free, use gluten-free flour to make your cake pops, or you can substitute the cake with giant marshmallows.\n4. Spooky Pull-Apart Cupcakes: Pull-apart cupcakes are a great way to feed a crowd without having to make an entire cake and cut it into pieces. Bake some cupcakes at home or purchase store-bought plain cupcakes that aren't already frosted. Then, you will assemble your cupcakes so they are sitting together in the desired shape. For example, if you were making a pumpkin pull-apart cake, you would assemble the cupcakes into a circular shape. Then, take your frosting and frost the cupcakes as though you were icing an entire cake. You can keep this as simple or make it as extravagant as you want. Some ideas for a Halloween-inspired pull-apart cake include a pumpkin, a ghost, or a tombstone. When guests want to eat a part of the cake, all they have to do is remove one of the cupcakes! Bake your cupcakes at home using gluten-free flour to make the recipe gluten-free.\n5. Mini Cobweb Cheesecakes: Make miniature vanilla cheesecakes (baked cheesecakes would work best for this recipe) in some Halloween-themed cupcake liners. Once the cupcakes have cooled in the fridge, take some black icing or melted dark chocolate, and use a piping bag to pipe a cobweb pattern onto the top of each cheesecake. For an extra spooky touch, you can add a candy or chocolate spider on top of the cobweb. To make the recipe gluten-free, you can leave out the crust on your cheesecakes, or make the crust using gluten-free cookies or graham crackers.\n6. Graveyard Pudding: Take small plastic cups and fill them with chocolate pudding about 3/4 of the way up. Take some crumbled chocolate cake or chocolate sandwich cookies like Oreos, and use them to top the pudding to resemble the soil. Then take half a cookie that is rectangular or semi-rectangular in shape, such as a Milano cookie. Pipe \"RIP\" onto the cookies using icing or melted chocolate, then stick it on top of the soil to resemble a tombstone. You can also add some gummy worms on top of or inside the pudding mix. To make the recipe gluten-free, ensure the cake and/or cookies you are using for the soil and tombstones are gluten-free varieties. ", "role": "assistant"}], "category": "Brainstorm"}

Some other ideas are to substitute kale for spinach or to try something completely different like a beet or carrot smoothie. \n\n2. Roast them in the oven. Roasting vegetables with a bit of salt, pepper, and oil can be a great way to add flavor and texture without much effort. Some great roasting vegetables include broccoli, Brussels sprouts, and cauliflower.   \n\n3. Make appealing salads to go. A new social media-inspired health trend is to prepare attractive-looking salads in convenient and ready-to-go containers such as mason jars. The salads are put in the container in layers with dressing at the bottom, followed by vegetables that are not vulnerable to water such as chopped broccoli, cauliflower, cucumbers, tomatoes, and carrots. After that, you can add leafy vegetables such as lettuce, cabbage, spinach, and kale. You can also add a lean protein like chicken, some nuts, or even a bit of fruit depending on what you're in the mood to eat. \n\n4. Spiralize them and use them instead of noodles. Spiralized zucchini, summer squash, or even beets can be a great change of pace for a plate of pasta with tomato sauce. Use them exactly as you would regular pasta for a delicious and healthy low-carb meal.   \n\n5. Add them to desserts. If you're looking for something indulgent, consider carrot cakes, pumpkin pies, and sweet potato puddings as some sweet treats that incorporate vegetables. If you would prefer something a bit healthier overall, you might be interested in trying roasted beets in chocolate pudding cakes, kale in carrot muffins, or zucchini in coconut chocolate cookies, to name a few possibilities. \n\nI hope that these ideas inspire you to find new and creative ways to add vegetables to your diet. Remember to experiment and develop unique recipes that work for your goals!", "role": "assistant"}], "category": "Brainstorm"}

Our general house cleaning services are designed to help seniors maintain a clean and hygienic living space without having to worry about the physical strain of cleaning themselves. \n- Deep Cleaning: Our deep cleaning service goes beyond the surface level and tackles areas that are difficult to reach and often overlooked during regular cleaning routines. In addition to improving air quality, deep cleaning can also extend the life of your furniture and appliances by removing built-up grime and debris.\n- Organization: As we get older, it gets more difficult to keep things organized.  This can increase the risk of falls and other accidents in the home. Decluttering not only creates a safer living environment but also promotes mental clarity and reduces stress.\n- Sanitization: Seniors are particularly vulnerable to bacteria and viruses due to weakened immune systems. Our home sanitizing service can provide a thorough deep clean including everything from disinfecting high-touch surfaces like doorknobs, light switches, and counters to steam cleaning carpets and wiping down baseboards.\n", "role": "assistant"}], "category": "Brainstorm"}

Here are some ways to get your dog to listen to you:\n\n1. Treats: Most dogs are food-motivated, so finding some yummy treats is a great way to get them to listen to you. You can also use their kibble if your dog is on a special diet or can't have too many treats. Every dog is different, so make sure you consider what treats your dog loves best. \n2. Toys: If your dog has a favorite toy, you can also use this as motivation. Make sure your dog is aware of you holding the toy when you ask them to do something.\n3. Practice Without Distractions: If you're having trouble getting your dog to listen to you in a place where there are plenty of distractions, like in the park or on a busy street, try practicing somewhere without distractions first. At home is ideal, as there should be nothing out of the ordinary.\n4. Start Easy: Make sure you start with easy commands and build up. Use the ones your dog already knows well when trying to motivate them to listen to you.\n5. Use a Long Leash: If training recall, make sure you attach a long leash to your dog until their recall is solid. This will prevent them from running off.\n6. Always Use Positive Reinforcement: Lastly, don't punish your dog for not listening to you. This can result in your dog being fearful of you or aggressive towards you and failing to understand what you want from them. Praise your dog for doing the right thing, and try not to react when they don't.\n\nEvery dog is different, so finding out what motivates your dog is important. It's also important to be understanding of their age, as a small puppy is much less likely to respond to you every time than an adult dog who's had plenty of practice.", "role": "assistant"}], "category": "Brainstorm"}

Plank\nThe plank is the most renowned exercise that targets your entire core. A plank is an exceptional way to strengthen your abs and your obliques and work your deep muscle to increase your overall stability and power. To perform a plank, start in a pushup position, then move down to rest your weight on your forearms with your hands touching so that your arms can form a V shape. From this position, maintain your straight posture and avoid your stomach sagging. Hold the position for as long as you can. It won't be long before you feel the burn. \n\n2. Side plank\nPay particular attention to your obliques by performing a side plank as an alternative to a normal plank. Start by getting into a standard plank position. Next, rotate your body so that one side of your body faces the sky. Squeeze your core with one leg straight out and your body stiff in a straight line. Squeeze your core and hold the pose for as long as possible before switching sides. Make sure to try equal lengths on both sides so that you don't get muscle imbalances. \n\n3. Reverse Crunches\nCrunches are a great exercise for your core, but this variation adds a slight degree of difficulty if you are finding standard crunches too easy. This exercise works the lower abs, in particular. Start in a standard crunch position, lying down with your knees bent. Keep your hands flat on the ground next to your hips. To perform the exercise, lift your pelvis and knees towards your face. Return to the starting position and repeat as many times as you can. \n\n4. Flutter kicks\nSometimes the lower abs can get less attention, but flutter kicks can help to address that. This exercise makes sure you strengthen a common area of weakness. Lay flat on the ground with your arms flat and legs stretched out. From here, lift your feet about 6 inches off the ground and hold them there. Once you have done this, start lifting right and left. Lift each leg about a few inches each time. Ensure to maintain good posture and bring each leg to rest before moving to the next. \n\n5. Arms high sit-ups\nEveryone knows sit-ups, and those who work their abs a lot may be easy by now. This exercise gives your abs a killer workout that they won't forget. It is as easy as starting in a sit-up position. From here, raise your hands straight up to the sky, flatten your hands, and reach for the sky. Now perform a sit-up as you normally would. This is going to be a lot harder than a standard sit-up so make sure your form is correct to achieve maximum results. ", "role": "assistant"}], "category": "Brainstorm"}

Helped by her love of books and a sympathetic teacher, Mrs. Honey, Matilda develops special powers that surprise her family and delight the audience at the same time.  \n4. Honey I Shrunk The Kids (1989). This classic 1980s family comedy follows a scientist played by Rick Moranis who accidentally shrinks his four children with a shrink ray he thought didn't work. When he throws the device out, his quarter-of-an-inch-sized kids have to navigate their way through the yard and back to the house while combatting now-dangerous obstacles like sprinkler systems and stampedes of ants.\n5. Lion King (1994). This coming-of-age animated classic has great songs and a powerful story about a young lion named Simba who must overcome the tragic loss of his father, Mufasa, and learn to inherit his birthright. \n\nI hope that at least one of these options is suitable for your family.

Dewy Glow - The Dewy Glow makeup style has a fresh appearance that isn't greasy. It's sort of an in-betweener, going between no makeup and a full face.

Visitors find plenty of wildlife in the form of squirrels, birds, and ducks. There\u2019s a beautiful waterfall, along with a unique Japanese temple. You can rent a paddle or row boat and be sure to bring a picnic lunch and your camera.\n\n2. Twin Peaks\nThis area was once known as \u201cLos Pechos de la Choca\u201d or the Breasts of the Maiden. At 922 feet high, Twin Peaks offers remarkable views of the entire Bay Area. Though many do come to enjoy the spectacular 180-degree vistas, there are numerous other opportunities to explore the indigenous flora and fauna. \n\n3.

In a pinch, you could even use the mini toolset for repairing eyeglasses. These sets are often cheap and low quality, but the screwdrivers tend to be good enough for a quick fix on stage.\n\n- A flashlight. While there may be stage lighting during the performance, if you need to make a quick repair, it is better to have a small but effective light source of your own, in case of emergencies. You can certainly use the big bulky one from home, but a pen light might be more effective and easier to use when you need to hold tools as well. If hands-free is your thing, you could also get a headlamp, which usually has a small strap attached to it. But if you have a modern cell phone, you probably already have an app that turns on the camera flash.\n\n- Pliers. A small pair of pliers can work wonders for a bent jack or for cutting and replacing a broken string. They don\u2019t need to be too big, and you can usually find a small set of two or three at your favorite hardware store. \n\n- Allen/hex key set. These might not be completely necessary for certain players, but Allen screws are used on a lot of musical equipment, so it would be a good idea to have a set around. While you can buy keys as a set for a toolbox, keep on the lookout for a set that looks like a Swiss Army knife, commonly called a Gui-Tool.

With these platforms, you can set your own schedule.\n-Sign up with a delivery service - Many delivery services like Instacart will allow delivery drivers to set their own schedules. \n-Take surveys online - There are many different platforms that pay users low rates to take surveys online, such as MTurk, Prolific, Springboard Panel, and Ipsos. The pay rate is usually relatively low, but you'll have a lot of freedom to set your own schedule and decide which surveys are (or aren't) worth your time.\n-Sign up for pet-sitting services - Platforms like Rover.com allow you to market yourself as a dog walker or pet sitter. You can visit other people's homes to check on their pets or host their pets at your home for a single day or multiple overnight stays. You'll have the power to decline any offer that doesn't suit your schedule. \n-Sign up for focus groups - With focus groups, you can get paid just to share your opinion on products or entertainment. These groups often require you to be present in person or virtually for specific hours, but you can always decline if the scheduled time doesn't work for you. The same is true of signing up for mock juries. \n-Become a mystery shopper - There are several different services that will pay you to visit stores and businesses as an undercover quality control analyst. Typically, they'll provide you with a checklist of things to review in the store and very clear instructions. All you have to do is visit the spot in question on your own time, follow the directions, and get paid. If the directions require you to make a purchase, the company will reimburse you. \n-Sell arts and crafts - If you've got a hobby (or more than one) that produces marketable products, consider selling them on platforms like Etsy, eBay, or Shopify. If your schedule is unpredictable, consider setting a shop policy that informs buyers that you're only available to ship items and respond to customer inquiries on certain days/times each week. You can also sell these items on your own website or at craft vendor fairs. \n-Re-sell used items - There are plenty of websites and brick-and-mortar stores where you can sell your used clothes, electronics, furniture, appliances, and more. \n-Sign up for a copywriting platform - You may want to do some research on these platforms to determine which is the best fit, as some do require their writers to meet a monthly minimum of work hours. Some don't, though, and will simply list available short-term copywriting projects for you to take or leave as you see fit.\n-Start your own small business - You can work with clients as a writing coach, editor, or in any other capacity you feel qualified to. It will be up to you to determine when you meet with clients and for how long. You can also set your own pay rate.\n", "role": "assistant"}], "category": "Brainstorm"}

Here are three hobby ideas for an introvert who enjoys spending time alone and wants to learn something challenging along with an explanation for why you might enjoy each recommendation: \n\n1. Cooking. Learning to cook is a useful hobby for anyone, but it's especially well suited for an introvert as it's one that can be done entirely alone. It's also a great hobby for someone looking for a creative challenge as it can take months or even years to master fairly simple dishes and even then, there are an endless array of techniques and cuisines to learn. As someone who enjoys spending time alone and wants a challenge, cooking might just be the perfect hobby for you.  \n2. Chess. Although chess does involve another player, these days it is extremely easy to find opponents online, through apps, or you can even play against a computer, which makes this a suitable hobby for an introvert. One of the most challenging strategy games ever devised, chess is also perfect for someone who enjoys a mental test that will certainly help keep their mind active for hours on end.\n3. Running. If you want to spend time outside, but still avoid talking to other people, consider taking up running as a hobby. Not only are there obvious health benefits to this activity, but many runners point to a \"runner's high\" where your body releases endorphins that make you feel good after a run. As someone who enjoys a challenge, you should also note that running can be a useful way to develop both your mental and physical stamina as you train yourself to run faster and longer over time.\n\nI hope that you find these ideas helpful as you search for a new hobby.

What are some group games that we could play on the rink that will hold their attention and break up the long skating session?", "role": "user"}, {"content": "Here are some group roller skating games that can be used for a group of intermediate-level skaters in the middle school age group:\n\n* The Four Corner Game: The Four Corner game doesn't require any skating experience and is mostly a matter of luck. When the music plays, the skaters travel around the rink like normal. When the music stops, they find a corner. A designated dice roller will roll the large fuzzy die, and whichever corner number is rolled is removed from the game. This process of elimination continues until only one player is left and they are declared the winner. There are variations that can be used, such as playing odd/even corners or keeping the number that is rolled rather than eliminating that corner, which speeds up the game significantly.\n\n* Rockin' Robin (or the Record Game): This game is for skaters of intermediate skill. The DJ will play the songs \"Rockin' Robin\" or \"You Spin Me Round\" and blow the whistle throughout the song. When the whistle blows, skaters must turn and skate in the opposite direction. The whistle strikes may be fast and challenging, resulting in skaters making a complete circle. Skaters must pay close attention to the whistles.\n\n* Shoot the Duck: This game is played in teams, either red vs. blue or girls vs. boys. When the DJ blows the whistle, students must assume a squatting position on their skates and cannot use their legs to gain speed. As skaters lose momentum, they will stop moving and sit on their bottom. The goal is to be the last skater moving in order to earn a point for their team. The first team to five points wins the opportunity to skate one song all by themselves.\n\n* Dodgeball: For advanced skaters, adults/teachers/employees can throw the balls while students skate around the rink and \"dodge\" the balls. If a skater is \"hit,\" they must sit in the middle of the floor. The goal is to be the last skater standing. If a skater catches the ball, the adult must sit down, instead. Adults should begin by throwing the balls high, so they can be easily ducked under, but aim progressively lower as the song continues. \n\nThese games are competitive or involve silly movements that are sure to keep skaters engaged. Longer games such as dodgeball can be played during large skating blocks, while it's easier to fit Rockin' Robin and short rounds of The Four Corner Game in between other activities.

Take your guests to Meow Wolf to explore interactive, psychedelic exhibits crafted by local artists and funded by author George RR Martin, or bring them to see the Museum of Indian Arts and Culture, the New Mexico History Museum, or the Museum of International Folk Art.\n*Grab a bite - Santa Fe has excellent restaurants, whether you\u2019re looking for a tasty casual meal or a fine dining experience. CHOMP is an upscale food court hosting 4-5 popup restaurants, a bar, a dance floor, and a play area for kids. Plaza Cafe is a retro diner-style eatery serving breakfast all day as well as dinner, drinks, and desserts. Radish & Rye offers delicious upscale farm-to-table cuisine. Geronimo on Canyon Road is considered one of the best fine-dining restaurants in the country. Countless other restaurants in the area are sure to satisfy your guests\u2019 cravings and curiosities. \n*10,000 Waves - While this famed spa is known for its beautiful scenery and outdoor hot tubs, the facility is designed to make hot tub bathing pleasant through rain, sleet, or snow. The spa also offers indoor massage and spa treatments, as well as fine dining and luxury lodging accommodations, so there\u2019s plenty to do here, even if an outdoor soak is off the menu.\n*Violet Crown Cinema - The Railyard district in Santa Fe is often recommended for its outdoor concerts and easy walking, but there are a few indoor attractions worth visiting. Violet Crown Cinema is one of them. This movie theater has standard concessions, a full kitchen menu, and a bar serving wine and beer. You can dine in the lounge or take your food and drinks into the theaters. After the movie, you can walk less than 2 blocks to an indie bookstore, ice cream shop, pizza parlor, coffee shop, brewery, and boutique shopping\n*Sky Railway - Just around the corner from Violet Crown Cinema, you\u2019ll find the Jean Cocteau, a small, historic indie theater revived by author George R.R. Martin. The novelist and patron of Santa Fe\u2019s art scene also revived a dilapidated historical railroad line to create a luxe travel experience with Sky Railway. The train cars are outfitted in an antique style with food, drinks, and entertainment offered on board while the train travels right through the heart of Santa Fe\u2019s Railyard district, as well as into more scenic surrounding areas.\n*Tumbleroot - If your guests enjoy music, they might like to catch a show at Tumbleroot Brewery and Distillery. This spot has excellent quality drinks, diverse musical acts, a large dance floor, a gallery and merch space, and a beautiful outdoor space in the back with food trucks, a bar, and a frog pond. \n*Shopping - Santa Fe is overflowing with artisans, so the shops on the plaza are always stocked with beautifully crafted and unique pieces. In this area, window shopping is just about as entertaining as a museum visit. Even if your guests don\u2019t end up purchasing anything, they\u2019ll be sure to enjoy browsing.

Can you give me a list and explain how to do them?", "role": "user"}, {"content": "Here are some exercises you can do to train your legs without needing weights. \n\n1. Squats\nSquats have long been regarded as the best way to build strong legs and butt. The squat mainly works your quads, glutes, and core but will also work your hamstrings to a lesser extent.\n\nTo do a squat stand with your feet hip or shoulder width apart in a stable stance. From there, push your hips back as if you were going to sit down. While the hips are moving back, let your knees bend and move down until you feel the strain. Be sure to try and maintain vertical shins throughout the exercise. Once you are at your lowest point, you can begin to push yourself back up to a standing position. You can make this harder by adding a heavy backpack or holding something in each hand so long as the objects are equal in weight.\n\n2. Jump Squat\nSimilar to the standard squat, you can use a jump squat to improve your power and increase the intensity of the exercise. A jump squat will be more beneficial when building your fast-twitch muscle fibers. \n\nPerforming a jump squat is as easy as it sounds. Start off in a squat position and perform a standard squat. Once you are at your low point, use the power in your legs to jump up and make sure to land softly in the same position you started. Try to maintain form with this exercise. Keeping your legs controlled when jumping will also help to increase core strength. \n\n3. Lunge\nA lunge requires immense stability as you split your hips in half. A great exercise for your glutes, quads, and hamstrings, a lunge can be done pretty much anywhere. A lunge will also help you work your hip stabilizers as you try to maintain balance. \n\nA lunge is done by standing in a normal position with your feet. From here, extend one leg backward until both of your knees are at a 90-degree angle. Your front knee should not go past your toes. From here, push off with your back leg to regain your original stance. Repeat this for both legs as many times as you wish.\n\n4. Jump Lunge\nJust as a jump squat increases your fast-twitch muscle fibers, so will a jump lunge. A great exercise for building power in your legs. This exercise is not easy, so be careful when trying it, and ensure you are comfortable with a standard lunge first. \n\nTo do a Jump lunge, get into a lunge position as you would normally. From the point where your knees are bent, you can now jump up and alternate your legs in the air. This should be performed in a controlled way so that you land softly. \n\n5. Side Lunge\nA side lunge is similar to a normal lunge but has key differences. Firstly this exercise will work your abductors, glutes, and quads. Working different leg muscles on a lateral plane rather than a linear one is a good exercise. This is important as the range of motion we experience with our legs daily is large. \n\nStart off in a standing position. Next, move one leg out to the side. Imagine it's just one leg in a normal squat position. Your knee should be bent but not past your toes. Your other leg should be straight. From here, simply return to standing and alternate the legs as you go. \n\n6. Sumo Squat\nWe've done normal squats, so now here is the sumo squat. The sumo squat pays particular attention to your adductors, glutes, and quads. \n\nStart off by standing as a sumo with your legs wider than your shoulders to where it is comfortable. Keep your toes slightly pointed away from your body. From this position, perform a squat as you would usually, and again, be sure that your knee doesn't extend past your foot and that your shin stays as vertical as it can. \n\n\n\n\n", "role": "assistant"}], "category": "Brainstorm"}

Here are some ways you can bond with your cat that don't involve them being too active.\n\n1. Treats: Treats are a great way to bond with your feline companion. You can use handheld Churo treats if you want your cat to come close to you, as many cats love licking those treats.\n2. Toy Mice: Although some toys involve cats running around a lot, toy mice tend to be better as your cat can play with them in one spot if they choose to. Sit on the floor with your cat and toss them some toy mice, encouraging them to play. You can also get toy mice that have squeakers or catnip, both of which will further encourage your cat to get involved.\n3. Petting: Petting is a great, underrated way to bond with your cat. Make sure you take note of where your cat likes to be petted. Most cats don't like being touched on their belly, but some love head scratches! You can test this out by gently petting them in different places and looking for signs that they do or don't enjoy what's going on. If they don't enjoy it, try switching to petting them in a different place.\n4. Catnip: Providing catnip is a good way to bring your cat close to you. Try putting some in objects that are near you, as they'll attract your cat to come closer.\n5. Give Them Space: Believe it or not, giving your cat space can be a great way to bond with a skittish cat. Some cats would prefer to come to you rather than you coming to them, especially if they're new to your household. Chill near them, but don't force them to interact, and you might notice it's not long before your cat is sliding closer and warming up to you.\n\nRemember that all cats are different, so it's important to observe your cat's personality and learn their likes and dislikes.

Cup Pong Tournament: This is a bracket-style tournament where the teams will be randomly organized into pairs. Each pair will face off in a cup pong challenge where the quickest player to sink 3 ping pong balls into 3 cups wins the match. The winners face each other as they move down the bracket, and then a winner is determined. This is an exciting idea that parallels the tournament-style nature of college basketball.\n3. Escape Room: This can be booked at a local escape room in the team's area. Escape rooms are a great bonding activity for sports teams because they require collaboration and critical thinking.

These clues should be spread all across the college campus so that the teams are encouraged to work quickly and effectively. Reward the team that reaches the end of the hunt first.\n5.

Even house plants can be very picky when it comes to Florida's heat and humidity, but here are five suggestions of plants that should grow very well in your mother's new apartment:\n\n1: Aloe vera is a hardy little succulent. It is a very easy plant to grow, even for beginning gardeners or someone who does not have much time to tend to a plant. Not only is it beautiful, but it also has medicinal qualities and is used to soothe sunburns, cuts, and even constipation. It comes in several varieties, including hedgehog and tiger tooth. It can be damaged due to overwatering or too much sunlight.\n2: Jade plants are another succulent variety that can grow well in Florida. It is a stunningly beautiful plant that comes in several varieties, including dwarf and silver dollar. It is very easy to keep alive as it requires very little maintenance. All it requires is water, but be careful not to overwater it.\n3: For someone who might not like succulents, peace lilies are both pleasing to the eye and very versatile. They can grow in pots, hanging baskets, or even low-floral planters. They, too, have different types of peace lilies, including the Sonia peace and white stripe varieties. Other than overwatering, the biggest threat to a peace lily is its delicate nature. It would be best not to touch or move them too often.\n4: Orchids come in an array of colors and types and thrive in Florida homes. Whether you choose the cattleya, oncidium, or dendrobium orchid, you are going to be in for a treat with these beautiful flowers. The only threat to an orchid is too much water. It is recommended by many home gardeners to use an ice cube when it comes to watering your orchid.\n5: Basil is more of an herb than a houseplant, but it is used in many recipes and makes for a great windowsill plant. It only requires water once or twice a week. While it is one of the easiest herbs to grow, it is also susceptible to diseases including rot, blight, and fungus.", "role": "assistant"}], "category": "Brainstorm"}

Beekeeping - This suggestion is a bit more unusual, but beekeeping can be a great way to spend time outside of your home while also really learning to connect with and care for another living thing (or thousands of living things, really). On top of that, beekeeping benefits the environment and can be done in most urban or rural backyards. \n4.

Here is a list of tips on how to increase the chances of winning grant money. \n\nGrant writing can be an intimidating feat, but also an important aspect of business and community development. Here are some tips to increase your chances of winning funds: \n\n1. The first tip is to thoughtfully target funders. Grant funding research indicates that most awardees receive funding from private foundations, and after that, community foundations and corporations. So, while government grants tend to offer larger sums of money, they are harder to win. \n\n2. Though there is no magic number for the number of grant applications you should do, try and submit three at a minimum. Like any application process, the more you submit, the greater chance you\u2019ll have of receiving a \u201cyes.\u201d Completing multiple grant applications is also good practice; you\u2019ll likely get better and faster with each proposal. \n\n3. Well-researched grant proposals are more likely to be funded. This part of the application will take time and planning. If you don\u2019t feel up to it or have a grant writer in-house, consider hiring a grant writer to help with this part, or with the entire application. \n\n4. It may seem obvious, but it\u2019s imperative to meet the eligibility requirements. Sometimes grant applicants think that if the project or program is good enough and the proposal and well-written, funders may let it slide. More often than not, funders are looking for ways to eliminate applications due to the high number of applications received. Not meeting the eligibility requirements is a surefire way to get your proposal eliminated from consideration. \n\n5. Pay attention to all of the application\u2019s formatting requirements and guidelines. This is another way your proposal can be quickly eliminated if you do not follow the guidelines to a tee. Funders want to trust that you are detail-oriented and compliant with their standards and requests from the start. \n\n6. Ensure you submit a readable and error-free proposal. Bear in mind it will be another person or a group of people that review your grant application. The better the readability, the more likely the reviewers will be able to understand your objectives. Especially if you are writing in a second language or if you aren\u2019t keen on writing in general, again, consider hiring a professional grant writer to make sure your proposal is a well-written compelling argument that explains your objectives. \n\n7. Make your proposal unique. As mentioned above, funders are only human, and they will be able to determine patterns in applications. Try not to base your proposal on templates off the internet or copy another proposal. It takes more time and effort to be unique and authentic, but the rewards are greater. \n\n8. You\u2019ll want to have your finances in order, because funders may request additional materials that indicate you, your business, or your program is fiscally responsible.\n\n9. Play on your strengths. If you can prove without a doubt that the work you or your organization employs benefits the community, you\u2019re in a good position. Additionally, specific programs are more likely to receive funding than startup or operational costs. ", "role": "assistant"}], "category": "Brainstorm"}

Here is a list of common early pregnancy symptoms that may take place within the first trimester: \n\n1) Missed period- If you have missed your expected period start date by a week or more, odds are that this might mean you are pregnant. This may be less reliable if you have a consistently irregular menstrual cycle.\n2) Tender, swollen breasts- Your breasts may feel generally sensitive or sore or you may experience sharp pains in your breasts and/or nipples. This symptom may lessen after a few weeks.\n3) Nausea with or without vomiting- This is often referred to as morning sickness, although it can occur at any time of day. It will usually begin 1-2 months into pregnancy.\n4) Increased urination- This is likely because, with increased blood, your kidneys produce more fluid and this fluid ends up in your bladder.\n5) Fatigue- No one knows for certain what causes sleepiness during the first trimester of pregnancy although, a rapid rise in the levels of the hormone progesterone during early pregnancy might contribute. \n6) Moodiness- You may be unusually emotional and weepy or experience mood swings.\n7) Bloating- This is also due to hormonal changes. It may be similar to what you have experienced at the start of a regular menstrual period.\n8) Light spotting- Light spotting may be normal in the first 12 weeks, especially around the time that your period would have started. Spotting at this point is known as implantation bleeding. It happens when the fertilized egg attaches to the lining of the uterus \u2014 about 10 to 14 days after conception. Not all women will experience this.\n9) Cramping- Some women experience mild uterine cramping early in pregnancy, similar to those of your menstrual cycle, although they may feel quite different.\n10) Constipation- Hormonal changes cause your digestive system to slow down, which can lead to constipation.\n11) Food aversions- You might become more sensitive to certain odors and your sense of taste might change. \n12) Nasal congestion- Increasing hormone levels and blood production can cause the mucous membranes in your nose to swell, dry out and bleed easily. This might cause you to have a stuffy or runny nose.", "role": "assistant"}], "category": "Brainstorm"}

These pedal-powered capsules are finished in shiny chrome and are both unique and unusual.\n\n3. Toothbrush Fence (Te Pahu, Waikato): Interesting, if a little gross, you can visit a fence decorated with used toothbrushes, including ones from famous personalities such as a past Prime Minister and Flight of the Conchords stars. New Zealand has a tradition of adorning fences with collections of things - but this is certainly something else.\n\n4.

Video games and other online activities usually have some related local activities if you look. Having hobbies or interests in common is a great way for adults to make friends and start new relationships.\n\n* Take some time and reach out to people you haven't talked to in a while, whether it's family or old friends. A call, text, or email can spark up a past relationship that only lacked a bit of effort, and believe it or not, they probably miss you too.\n\n* Volunteering is a good way to meet new people and feel productive at the same time. You'll have a chance to do some networking, as well as help your local community.\n\n* Going back to school is a great way to renew your motivation and social life.  It doesn't have to be full-time, or to get a degree, it can be as little as one hour a week. Education outside of your job can provide much-needed brain stimulation and many opportunities to meet classmates with similar ideas.\n\nDo these hit the mark that you were thinking of?

Can you provide some different methods I could try?", "role": "user"}, {"content": "Potty training your dog to go outside can be hard. Here are some helpful tips for you to try.\n\n1. Outdoor Confinement: Create a small area of confinement outdoors. When your dog wakes in the morning, take them to this area of confinement and stand back. If your dog goes to the bathroom within the first ten minutes praise them. However, if they do not bring the dog back inside, keep them on a short leash under your watch. If the dog tries to go to the bathroom inside, interrupt them and take them back to the area of confinement. Slowly ween your dog out of the area of confinement once they are fully using this area within 10 minutes.\n\n2. Bells: Hang bells on your door knob. Each time you go outside use your dog's paw to tap the bells. The idea behind this is that when the dog needs to go to the bathroom, it will tap the bells, alerting you to the fact they need to go outside. \n\n3. Be Alert: Be alert to your dog's elimination patterns. Do they need to go to the bathroom after eating, sleeping, or playing? If there is a pattern, you can easily take your dog outside after these activities. This also includes signs your dog is exhibiting when needing to go outside to potty, such as:\n     \u2022 Spinning in circles.\n     \u2022 Going to areas where they have previously had accidents.\n     \u2022 Hiding in another room, around corners, behind furniture.\n     \u2022 Scratching or barking at the door. \n\n4. Timer: Set a timer! Sometimes we can lose track of time if the dog is not showing signs when they need to go outside. \n\nRemember to practice patience and not give up.

Sneak Attack: As a flanker, the character would specialize in doing their best work behind enemy lines and from advantageous positions.

Sneak Attack, which could ensure a guaranteed critical on the next attack by the character, would fit well into this role. \n4.

This would help to redirect enemy movements and to prevent more powerful enemies from catching up with the character.\n5: Sucker Punch: When cornered by a formidable enemy, Sucker Punch can disable them for one turn, rendering them unable to perform attacks of opportunity.

Peas: You don't have to worry about the interaction of peas and other plants. They grow well among all plants and don't hinder the health of other plants. They thrive in cooler temperatures, meaning you can plant them early in Idaho and harvest them into late fall. They don't need much space and are a relatively hardy plant.\n3.

They will need a stake or vegetable cage for support and to keep the wind from damaging them.\n4. Green Beans: Beans do well in Idaho summers because they are drought resistant, needing little water and doing well in direct sunlight. They also enrich the soil.

What are some good websites that I can use to showcase my work and spread my brand?", "role": "user"}, {"content": "Promoting your art can be hard. It's much more than simply selling art. Many creatives have trouble building the courage to put something they make online. Creatives need a thick skin when showing off something they created with love. That being said, it doesn't need to be difficult. Posting online is a great first step, so congratulations! When you think about marketing yourself online, selling things should be the last thing on your mind. Connect with enough people, and the rest will fall into place. There are many websites to help you do this, so here are a few suggestions.\n\n1. Instagram - Instagram is a wonderful tool for organically reaching a wide group of people. It is an image and video social media platform on which you can share fully finished works or even progress updates. Some artists even record themselves working and make videos played at faster speeds to show a full beginning to end in a short digestible video.\n2. Reddit (Related Subreddits) - Reddit can be a great place to submit your art, provided you go to the right sections. There are dozens of subreddits that can be beneficial to an up-and-coming artist. The community is moderated, but because it is an open forum, you might run into some trolls.\n3. Deviant Art - If you are into concept art and digital art, Deviant Art is the place to be. It has a huge community where you can follow other artists and comment on each other's work. An artist's Deviant Art page often also acts as their portfolio when applying for jobs. \n4. Pinterest - Pinterest is more of a visual search engine than a portfolio or social media page. If you put your work up on Pinterest, then others can pin it so they can add the post to their collection. They can even re-pin it so it reaches even more people.\n5. Wetcanvas Forums - Wetcanvas is an art-specific forum. While Reddit is a forum with thousands of different topics, Wetcanvas is a place solely for creative art. It is a wonderful place to connect with like-minded artists, get feedback on recent work, or ask for advice on anything you may be stuck on.", "role": "assistant"}], "category": "Brainstorm"}

You can search for local community theatres on google or google maps, although they don't always have websites so they can be tricky to find. Once you locate a local theatre, go to its website if it has one. If you want to act, you can try to find an auditions page on the site. If there isn't a site, you could also look for the theatre on Facebook. \n2. Get notified about auditions and events -  You can also find ways to get involved with community theatre by getting notified about events and auditions. You could sign up for their newsletter or by looking for upcoming auditions or events for community theatre groups. You can also ask via e-mail.\n3. Volunteer - There is more to theatre than just acting. There is also set building and painting, prop management, costuming, makeup, an entire crew, and more. If you want to get involved but aren't ready to act, volunteering for one of these positions can help you become part of the group.\n4. Audition - In community theatres, you don't always need experience. They're also typically looking for new people to act with them, with very little experience. You can start auditioning for smaller or non speaking parts and when you get comfortable, work your way into larger roles.", "role": "assistant"}], "category": "Brainstorm"}

Here are five classic supernatural creatures you might want to incorporate into your story.\n\n1: Vampires: Vampires have been used in mythology and stories for centuries, and there have been many iterations of them. Their lore tends to be that they are undead creatures of the night, with long fangs used to drink blood, and they can often turn into bats. Some versions of vampires created for stories or present in mythology are allergic to garlic, burned by sunlight, and can only be killed by a crucifix. \n2. Werewolves: Another classic supernatural creature often presented as a mortal enemy of the vampire is the werewolf. The werewolf is a creature that presents as human most of the time but, on a full moon, turns into a wolf. Depending on the story, this may be a classic version of a wolf or it may be a more monstrous version. Legends often say that if someone is bitten by a werewolf on the full moon, they will then turn into one.\n3. Ghosts: Ghosts are also supernatural creatures and subjects of many stories, and are typically humans who did not pass onto the afterlife, leaving a form of them stuck wandering the earth. Ghosts may be friendly to humans or not. There are many other names for ghosts, such as specters, spirits, and poltergeists (who are usually evil ghosts).\n4. Mages: Mages are humans who have been gifted with the ability of magic, also called witches, wizards, and sorcerers. Mages may be good, evil, or inherently neither in a story, and the magic they can do may vary. Sometimes, mages are not separate creatures at all but humans who have learned to do magic. They may also have animal familiars, though this is typically for witches.\n5. Demons: Born from religion, demons are also supernatural creatures that are sometimes used in fictional stories. They are creatures who have come from Hell, and may or may not have been human a long time ago, depending on the iteration of them. They are there to cause chaos and even harm to humans and usually make good villains in a story.", "role": "assistant"}], "category": "Brainstorm"}

You could snap pictures of the actual show or individual models to showcase their fashion.\n\n* EVERYONE'S A WINNER: If you'd like, you could give each guest (and the birthday girl) a unique award after the show such as Most Glamorous, Most Sassy, Best Hair, etc. \n\n* SCAVENGER HUNT: Before or after the fashion show, you could have guests participate in a fashion magazine scavenger hunt.

Cheaper Pricing: Although it's not guaranteed, Airbnbs are often less expensive than large hotels since their prices aren't dictated by a corporation. \n4. More Flexibility: For the same reason, Airbnb might have more flexibility than a hotel, which usually has firmly fixed check-in and out times dictated by the company.

More Pet-Friendly: Many Airbnbs are more pet-friendly than hotels, though it's important to check with the owner.\n6. More Privacy: Depending on your booking, you may have more privacy in an Airbnb unlike having to cross through the hotel lobby every time you need to get in and out.\n\nRemember, it's always important to read the reviews and policies on Airbnb accommodations before a booking, as these aren't all guaranteed.

You can even set a timer so you don't have to focus on how long it's been. \n\n2. Use the Hong-Sau Technique\nTo perform the Hong-Sau Technique, sit perfectly upright with your legs folded. Slowly inhale for a count of eight, and then slowly exhale for the same count. During your inhale, say \"hong\" in your head. On each exhale, say \"sau\" in your head. Repeat six times to gain concentration and focus. \n\n3. Focus on comfort\nInstead of trying to maintain perfect posture, try to choose a position that is comfortable for you. Find a place with limited distractions where you can feel at peace. If you're more comfortable laying down or keeping your eyes open, that's ok too. \n\n4. Consume raisins \nStudies show that eating about half a cup of raisins, which contain boron, can help improve focus and attentiveness. \n\n5. Try a guided meditation\nGuided meditation can help you maintain focus and eliminate distractions by providing something to give you something to concentrate on that is related to your practice. \n\n6. Use earplugs\nEarplugs are a great way to eliminate distractions from outside noises. Noise-canceling headphones or white noise is another way to remove noisy distractions. \n\nLet me know if you would like any more suggestions, or if you want me to expand on any of the ideas listed here!\n", "role": "assistant"}], "category": "Brainstorm"}

Here are six tips to polish your interview performance:\n\n1. Arrive about 10-15 minutes early so that you can get acquainted with your surroundings and start your interview without making the interviewer feel rushed. They probably have a busy schedule, so they need to start your interview on time.\n2. Make sure you dress nicely! You don't have to wear a dress or a suit and tie, but arrive in business-casual attire, which includes dress pants, long-sleeved shirts, and closed-toe shoes. If you get hired, your HR manager will tell you more about the job dress code.\n3. Look up common job interview questions online, and practice answering them alone or with a friend. Note that your answers should almost always be positive even if the question seems to require a negative answer. For example, if the interviewer asks \"What's your biggest flaw?\", give them a minor flaw with a positive spin, such as \"Sometimes, I get a little too immersed in my work.\"\n4. Employers want extroverted employees. If you're an introvert, you don't have to invent a fake personality, but appear bubbly, friendly, and talkative. These employees work the best with customers and colleagues, making them ideal job candidates.\n5. Be professional, but don't worry about being perfect. If you're too perfect, it's creepy. Make a good first impression while letting the best parts of your personality shine through.\n6. Follow up within a week with a simple email or phone call, showing them that you like this employer and want to start working with them.", "role": "assistant"}], "category": "Brainstorm"}

Dead hang pull-up. \nThe dead hang pull-up is a variation of the standard pull-up and is excellent for working your biceps. Start by grabbing a pull-up bar underhanded so your palms are facing you. Your arms should be about shoulder-width apart. Hold your weight, cross your legs behind your body, and raise your feet slightly so your knees are bent. This is your starting position. To perform the exercise, pull yourself up so that your collarbone is in line with the bar. The trick to performing this exercise is to lower yourself at a slower pace. About 4 seconds will be best. Now repeat until you are unable to do any more. \n\n2. Rolling skull crusher with press. \nStart by lying on a bench with a dumbbell in each hand, raised straight above your chest. Now allow your elbows to bend so that the dumbbells fall beside your head in a controlled manner. Now reverse this motion so that the dumbbells are in the original position and perform a press like a bench press. Once you have completed all these motions, that's considered one rep. This exercise works your triceps and chest, so it's versatile when trying to build muscle. You can use a Swiss ball instead of a bench for more difficulty. This will work your abs as well. \n\n3. Drag curl.\nEveryone knows that curls help to build your biceps and arms in general. This exercise is no different in that sense but is performed with some differences. Start by holding the barbell with a shoulder-width, underhand grip. Now you should pull your shoulders down and back. When doing this, you should drag the bar up the front of your body, keep your elbows around, and slowly lower the barbell. To work slightly harder, try using dumbbells instead of a barbell. \n\n4. Grasshopper pushup.\nLike curls, pushups are renowned as an excellent exercise for building muscle and strength. This variation pays particular attention to your arms. To perform this exercise, get in a standard pushup position, but instead of having your palms open, use your fists to stabilize yourself.  The inside of your hands should be facing each other. Once in this position, you perform a pushup as usual by lowering your chest to the ground and pushing back up to start. If this hurts your fists, you can face your fingers out to work the same muscles. \n\n5. Supinated cable row. \nTo perform this exercise, you will need a cable station. Use the low pulley on the cable station and attach a straight bar. Using an underhand grip, shoulder width apart, row the bar towards your belly button and return with control. Keep your hips back and your stance soft so that your torso is around 45 degrees angle to vertical. You can also do this with a barbell once you have mastered the exercise with the cable station.

Of course, always exercise caution if and when you decide to meet up with anyone you have been talking to online.\n2. Befriend colleagues: If you're starting a new job in the city, this is an easy way to meet new people and build friendships. If you have some colleagues that you click with, try asking them if they'd like to hang out outside of work and see how that goes.\n3. Social events: Going to a large event is a great way to meet new people and maybe even develop friendships. For example, if you have a favorite music artist who is playing a show in your city, turn up a little early and try to strike up conversations with others waiting in line. Your shared love of the artist will already give you a common ground for building a friendship.\n4. Take up a new hobby: Whether you have an existing hobby or want to take up a new one, it is a good way to meet new people who share your interests. Look online to see if there are any local groups or meet-ups for people who pursue the hobbies you enjoy.\n5. Friendship apps: Apps aren't just for dating anymore!

Take a shower - Make sure you take a bath or shower before you go on your date. Don't go on a date immediately after work without getting clean and refreshed, as you may be carrying around sweat and grime from your job.\n2. Get a haircut - Get unkempt hair under control. Cut your hair so it looks presentable, or if you elect to keep your hair long, at least put it in a ponytail or bun so it doesn't overhang your ears or get into your food when you're eating.\n3. Groom your facial hair - If you have a beard or mustache, shave it off. If your date wants to get closer to you, you don't want your facial hair poking them or giving them a rash when you both get physically close and intimate. Or, if you insist on keeping your facial hair, at the very least, you should trim and groom it so it doesn't look scraggly.\n4. Use fragrances (but don't overdo it!) - cologne or deodorant is always a plus...put some on before your date so you smell extra good. But don't overdo it, because an overwhelming smell of cologne can be too pungent for your date's nose and can put them off completely.\n5. Dress to impress - Unless the occasion warrants it, don't come to a date with a t-shirt, surf shorts, and slippers/flip-flops. Dress nicely; this means wearing something that would be used on a date, like slacks or dress pants (or jeans), a button-up shirt or polo shirt, and closed-toe shoes.\n6. Have transportation - If you don't have a mode of transportation, you can always get an Uber or taxi to take you to the location of the date. But try to secure some mode of transportation so you can easily travel to and from the date, or even take your date home when it's all over. For example, a bicycle would not be a good choice of transportation for two people.\n7. Pick a nice place - Consider going on a date to a place that is fun and where both of you will enjoy being there, such as on a walk on the beach, to a nice restaurant or coffee shop, or to a movie at the theater. Places that are hectic or frenetic can be offputting to your date and can make conversation and getting to know them better near impossible (e.g. loud concerts, live fighting events, etc.)\n8. Be polite - Be nice to your date; be a gentleman and mind your manners. Avoid using foul or abrasive language, be complimentary to your date, and show interest in the other person rather than focusing your conversation on yourself (unless your date asks you questions about yourself).\n9. Refrain from using your phone - In this day and age of increased cell phone use, one of the best ways to show you are disinterested in your date is to use your phone while you are in their presence. Put the phone down, make eye contact with your date, and don't check calls or emails without at least asking permission from your date before doing so. Even then, try to keep the phone checking short and screen your calls so you aren't talking on the phone unless it is an emergency.", "role": "assistant"}], "category": "Brainstorm"}

I would be happy to go into detail about three famous concepts in statistics, mathematics, and physics!\n\n1. The Invention of Calculus - Isaac Newton invented the concept of calculus in 1665. Although calculus has uses in physics, biology, economics, engineering, chemistry, and more, its most common association is with mathematics. Calculus is about studying the rate of change over time. Differential calculus can be compared to algebra. Calculus is used to define the slope of the curve, while algebra is more focused on straight lines. Integral calculus is used when the area under a graph needs to be calculated. It can break a sloped line into smaller segments to solve a problem that algebra can't.\n\nIsaac Newton found that when trying to describe the speed of a falling object, the speed increased every second, although no mathematical solution explained why at the time. He found the explanation through calculus and used the same formula to explain the orbits of the sun, moon, and other planets. There are many uses for calculus today: it is heavily tied into all aspects of engineering, it can be used when data is being collected and analyzed, and, of course, it is still taught in various forms at the high school and, more typically, college level. Its invention also allowed for other scientific theories to come after it, such as the theory of relativity.\n\n2. The Theory of Relativity - Widely known as the most famous theory in all of physics, the theory was invented by Albert Einstein. He had published a paper ten years earlier than his more famous theory about \"special relativity,\" which explained space and time, but the theory did not address gravity. Einstein's theory expanded upon Newton's by determining the laws of physics are the same for all non-accelerating observers. He also showed the speed of light on its own is the same no matter what speed the observer is traveling. Equations for this theory also prove that massive objects distort spacetime. Light bends around massive objects like black holes, allowing it to act as a lens for things that are behind it; this is used by scientists to observe stars. Another aspect of the theory of relativity that is widely known is its direct impact on allowing the invention of the atomic bomb. Einstein was around during its creation but did not directly work on it himself, instead warning about the potential of its possible impact.\n\n3. Normal Distribution - One of the most common concepts in statistics, also known as the Bell Curve, normal distribution affects many parts of our everyday lives. It explains various distributions such as the heights of the general public, errors in measurement, blood pressure, marks on a test, and intelligence of the populace, just to name a few examples. Related to the normal distribution is the standard deviation; the highest number of examples occur right in the middle of the graph, while standard deviations to the left and right are much less common. Typically two standard deviations away from the mean are rare, while three or more are exceedingly rare. This explains things like why there are so few extremely intelligent people. The probability of distribution means the odds of it happening are very unlikely, all factors considered.", "role": "assistant"}], "category": "Brainstorm"}

{"prompt": "Hi, I need 10 reasons why I should get a pet frog. I'm on the fence about it, but my best friend loves frogs and keeps trying to talk me into it. Thank you!", "prompt_id": "75616f84a5b889cb172f8a32b388e42f68af03c6f02fd0a0866f410bf45195bc", "messages": [{"content": "Hi, I need 10 reasons why I should get a pet frog. I'm on the fence about it, but my best friend loves frogs and keeps trying to talk me into it. Thank you!", "role": "user"}, {"content": "Frogs are incredible animals, and here are ten reasons why you should get one:\n\n1. Frogs are relatively low-maintenance pets. Each species requires different care, so you should still research them heavily before you bring one into your living space, but they largely stay in their tanks and don't need you to walk or play with them like a dog or cat.\n2. You can choose from hundreds of frog and toad species, each with unique traits. They have different songs, patterns, food and environment preferences, and levels of friendliness--yes, a frog can be friendly! Some are easier to care for than others as well.\n3. Frogs delight you with their charming love songs. Look them up online, and see which one is your favorite. They have a range of different sounds: some croak, some bark, and some even make vibrating sounds.\n4. You don't need a lot of space for a pet frog. If you live in an apartment, your landlord may permit a frog even if they don't let you have other types of pets. Just make sure that their tank is the right size for their species. They need plenty of room to climb and grow.\n5. Frogs are affordable. You'll sink some money into your new pet, but they don't need vaccinations, large quantities of expensive food (usually), or other expenses associated with mammals.\n6. If you don't have a pet store in your area, you can order frogs and toads online. This broadens your options because even pet stores carry a limited selection of species--if they carry frogs at all. You can even buy tropical varieties, such as red-eye tree frogs and poison dart frogs (captive varieties aren't poisonous.)\n7. Frogs are important, but they're not a lifetime commitment. You should still do your research because some species can live for twenty years if you care for them correctly. However, your pet probably won't outlive you as some species might.\n8. If you have kids, having a frog is a good way to teach them about responsibility and pet ownership without committing to a large mammal.\n9. You can gently handle frogs and toads as long as you wash your hands first and wear rubber gloves.\n10. Multiple frogs can live in the same tank if it's large enough--just do your research to make sure that you don't overcrowd them. Additionally, if you end up with male and female pairs, watch out for eggs! Frogs get frisky during mating season.\n\nOn a final note, make sure you buy frogs from a reputable pet store or breeder. Some kidnap them from other countries, causing many to die in transit, or breed them in unsafe conditions. Support people who treat frogs ethically. They're little lives, but they're just as important as any other creature.", "role": "assistant"}], "category": "Brainstorm"}

Here are six ways to rev up your brain to feel more alert and attentive in the mornings when it\u2019s hard to get out of bed! \n\n1. Take a cold shower with revitalizing scents to jolt your nervous system! \n\nMost people don\u2019t want to get out of the warm embrace of their blankets, so a cold shower may take time to work up to. The cold water is an immediate wake-up call to your nervous system, but a lukewarm shower with revitalizing scents in shampoo and body wash can be just as effective. The best scents for alertness are spicy or have citrus notes, such as orange, cinnamon, rosemary, and peppermint. \n\n2. Avoid the allure of sugary cereals and other sweet breakfast foods. \n\nWhile it may be tempting to grab a doughnut and a Frappuccino on the way to work, resist the urge. Sweet breakfasts will increase your blood sugar, which can make you feel alert for a few hours before a hard crash of fatigue in the afternoon. \n\nStick to a hearty, healthy breakfast with protein and heart-healthy fats instead. Eggs and bacon are a classic, but you could also blend a smoothie, have a slice of avocado toast, or opt for rolled oats with berries and a glass of whole milk. \n\n3. Drink a glass of ice-cold water before your morning cup of coffee. \n\nMany people can\u2019t wait to have their cup of coffee in the mornings but steer clear until you\u2019ve awakened your mind and body with a cold glass of water. Dehydration is a common cause of fatigue, so a glass of cold water will refresh your nervous system to get you moving in the AM. \n\n4. Listen to something upbeat, like a comedic, engaging podcast or your favorite \u201cget up and go\u201d music. \n\nPutting yourself in a good \u201cgo-getter\u201d mood will help you awaken your senses in the mornings. Upbeat music or laughter are both great ways to help you feel more alert and prepped to take on the day. \n\n5. Stretch and work out fatigue with a quick walk outdoors. \n\nNot only will a good stretch and regular exercise help you sleep better, but a quick stroll outdoors in the morning is a change of scenery that tells your body and mind that it\u2019s time to wake up for the day. Slow stretches work out kinks that accumulate in muscles while asleep.\n\n6. Allow natural sunlight to permeate your surroundings in the mornings. \n\nThis one may make you groan with dread, but sunshine suppresses melatonin production within your body. Melatonin is the chemical that makes you sleepy, and that\u2019s encouraged in dark environments. Standing in sunlight for a few minutes after you wake up tells your mind and body that the day is getting started. \n", "role": "assistant"}], "category": "Brainstorm"}

Make Estimated Quarterly Payments: The IRS requires all self-employed individuals in the US to make estimated quarterly payments for the tax they will owe at the end of the year. Doing this can help save on fines and penalties.\n2. Save More Than Needed: Since it's almost impossible to estimate the exact amount of tax you will owe, it's always a good idea to put aside a little more than you think you might need. That way, if you do owe more, it won't be a problem, and if you end up getting some money back, it will be a nice surprise for your savings.\n3. Keep Track of Expenses: The IRS allows you to write off business expenses, so make sure you keep track. Although they don't ask for evidence when submitting, they may if you're ever audited, so having receipts is a good idea. Some people keep a separate credit card and put all business expenses on that to make them easy to track.\n4. Get a Professional Tax Preparer: Tax laws can be complicated, especially if you're self-employed. Getting a professional tax preparer can ensure you receive all of the refunds and credits you're entitled to, so you don't pay more than you have to.\n5. Never Lie or Exaggerate: It's crucial to make sure you understand the IRS's rules and follow them.

NES - The NES came out in America in 1985, and it helped the North American video game market recover from its crash in 1983. This console was a place to play 8-bit titles, and it was the best-selling gaming console of its time. Originally, the NES was marketed as Famicom in Japan, but it was renamed to the NES when it came to America. When it came out, there was a $99 option that came with Super Mario Bros. There was also a $199.99 deluxe set that came with accessories and two games.\n2. SNES - Nintendo followed up the NES with the SNES in 1990. This makes it the second home console developed by Nintendo, and it was also a huge success. When it was released, it had to compete with Sega's Mega Drive. That being said, the Nintendo titles played a role in making it the best-selling console of its time. There were different versions, and cartridges couldn't be played on consoles that came from another country. The SNES was called the Super Famicom in Japan.\n3. Virtual Boy - The Virtual Boy came out in 1995, and it was a torchlight in virtual reality. That being said, it was a disaster in terms of its release. This console could be placed on a surface, and players could see it by leaning forward into the visor. This made some players feel sick to their stomachs, and it had a very short lifespan.\n4. Nintendo 64 - The Nintendo 64 came out in 1996, and it utilized a 64-bit CPU, making it truly powerful for its time. The Nintendo 64 was less popular than previous consoles, and this was in part due to the competition from Sony and Sega. Today, it's still known as an amazing console.\n5. Nintendo GameCube - The GameCube came out in 2001, and it was the first Nintendo console to use optical discs. It also allowed players to save their games through the use of memory cards that went up to 64 MB. The Gamecube came by at a time with a lot of competition. Competitors included Sony, Microsoft, and Sega. It had lots of initial success but didn't sell many consoles in the long run.

A closet with extra ceiling height can benefit from pull-down shelves or rods. Be careful that items won't fall off, however, if your child tugs too hard.\n6. Create cubbies for toys and label what goes where so that children know exactly where their playthings belong.\n7. Let your child have some input on how to decorate the closet space. This may mean letting them choose a paint color or switching out ordinary drawer pulls for something more exciting.\n\nI hope this helps!", "role": "assistant"}], "category": "Brainstorm"}

", "role": "user"}, {"content": "Here are those SEO writing tips for you:\n\n1. Write for people - An important factor in SEO is backlinks. These are essentially links to your website from other websites. That means that you want to make the content focused on humans. If there are too many keywords or it sounds robotic, it won't have as much of an opportunity to be shared.\n2. Understand the algorithm - Google updates its algorithm frequently, so it's important to be up to date in your knowledge of the algorithm. This also goes for any other search engine you are trying to share your content through. What Google looks for is webpages with the best quality, and they make their updates to make sure their search engine is effective.\n3. Find and use keywords - To make an SEO-optimized blog, you need to do some keyword research. You want a main keyword, which may have too much competition in search. So, when you choose keywords, you should look for keywords that aren't searched as often. If they aren't searched as much, they will have less competition. It also helps to find words to go along with your keywords. Doing so tells search engines that your content actually is about the topic it says it's about. \n4. Link out to quality sites - Using links shares where your information comes from, and your information should come from high-quality sites. Search engines want helpful information to be easily available, and linking out to good sites tells these engines that you use good sources.\n5. Use Subheadings -  You can also use subheadings that include keywords. These break the text up into smaller portions which makes it easier to read through. Using keywords in subheadings also puts them in a more prominent spot than in the text.", "role": "assistant"}], "category": "Brainstorm"}

Chronological Order \nChronological order is a way to organize ideas as a storyteller or writer. It involves dishing out ideas in the precise order of time from first to last. This type of order is used most often in expository writing or narratives that inform or explain something. It is particularly useful when describing an event or a series of events. \n\nConsider when you were younger, and you were trying to explain to the principal why you shouldn't be placed in detention. You had to describe the events that led to that problem carefully and in order so that they would understand your point of view. When writing, you do the same thing when you need to help your reader navigate the process and understand the context of the narrative. Some transition words to use when writing in chronological order include first, then, next, last, and finally. \n\n2. Logical Order \nLogical order is precisely what it sounds like. The framework is used to avoid any confusion for the reader. You will need to organize your ideas in this framework if your reader requires a good understanding at one point before you can move on to the next point. \n\nBefore a teacher talks to their students about Robert Frost's poem The Road Not Taken, for instance, they would need to give an example of what it's like to make a big or difficult decision. That way, the listener or reader will understand the true nature of the poem when they hear it. Some good transitional words or phrases to use for this order include: First, you should understand; keep that in mind while I explain; remember when I said; etc. \n\n3. Climactic Order \nWith this order, you keep the most important part until the very end of the story or piece. You should use it when you want to build up excitement such as in a suspense story, or when writing a list ranking items from worst to best. You want the final point to resonate with your reader and, therefore, save it for the very end. Some transitional phrases to use with this order include: first of all, more importantly, just as importantly, and finally. \n\n4. Random Order \nThis order allows you to put your ideas out there on a whim without any specific or logical reasoning behind them. You can organize your ideas this way when your points all have equal value of importance or they can sit independently with one another in understanding. You will want to use association ideas between points to transition from one thought to the next instead of using transition terms or phrases. \n\n5. Spatial Order \nWith this order, you describe a scene as things are arranged in their physical space by moving from one detail to the next or as viewed from one stationary vantage point. This order is used whenever you want your readers to visualize the space or if you want to improve a scene by causing the reader to use all their senses. Use this arrangement when you want to organize the ideas you are describing in your workspace, like a product use or a place description. It is a great way to slow down a story when it is getting too intense or if you want to pace yourself before revealing a surprise. Add in a few point-of-view descriptions of the setting at the moment. Some transition words to use for this order include, just to the left or right, behind, between, across from, arising out of, etc. ", "role": "assistant"}], "category": "Brainstorm"}

Your sunscreen should be broad-spectrum protection with an SPF of 15 or greater. For the best results, if you don\u2019t get into the water, reapply every 2 hours. However, if you get into water or sweat excessively, slather a new layer on as directed on the bottle, which is usually every 30 to 45 minutes. \n\n\u2022\tEat a nutritious diet to naturally protect skin cells against sun damage. \n\nSome foods are packed with antioxidants specifically to prevent skin cell damage and encourage fortified protection from UV rays. While food doesn\u2019t do all the work when it comes to the prevention of sun damage, you need foods that are rich in vitamin C, vitamin E, niacin, folate, omega-3 fats, and carotenoids. \n\n-  These fruits and vegetables and packed with vitamin C -  oranges and grapefruits, red peppers, broccoli, and tomatoes. \n-  Wheat germ oil, almonds, and sunflower seeds are great sources of Vitamin E\n-  Carotenoids are needed to help keep your skin and eyes healthy. Some carotenoic-rich foods are bell peppers, cantaloupe, mangoes, and sweet potatoes.\n-  Foods high in niacin are chicken breast, salmon, brown rice, and peanuts. \n-  Folate-rich foods include beef, liver, spinach, and Brussels sprouts.\n-  Foods that are full of Omega-3 are fish, especially salmon and sardines, flax and flaxseed oil, walnuts, and canola oil. \n\n\u2022\tAvoid \u201cpeak times\u201d for summer sunshine. \n\nThe sunshine is typically the hottest and brightest between 10 am and 2 pm, depending on where you live. To avoid the most intensive UV rays, try to stay indoors or in the shade between those hours. \n\nOther things to remember about skin protection and sun damage: \n\n- There\u2019s no such thing as waterproof sunscreen! Water resistance is based on spectrum, brand, and SPF, but no sunscreen can be completely waterproof. Every sunscreen has re-appliance directions based on how much you swim or sweat while outdoors. \n\n- Umbrellas can lend protection from sun damage. Headed to the beach? Take a large umbrella with you to sit under when you aren\u2019t cruising the shoreline or playing in the waves. You\u2019ll get to enjoy the sand and the surf without the direct effects of UV rays on your skin. \n\n- Sunscreen and precautions against sun damage are important every day, even on cloudy days, especially when the sunshine is strongest, brightest, and hottest in the summer months. The sun\u2019s UV rays can penetrate clouds, resulting in burns, even though they may not be as severe or appear as quickly as they would on clear days. \n", "role": "assistant"}], "category": "Brainstorm"}

Wilson: Certainly not the world\u2019s favorite Batman, Lewis G. Wilson was the youngest and least athletic actor ever to take on the role, and he didn\u2019t have quite the Batman voice that everyone has come to \n   love. \n- Robert Lowery: In the 1940s and 50s, Robert Lowery played Batman several times and was considered quite an upgrade from his predecessor. \n- Adam West: For several decades, Adam West played a flamboyant version of Batman, who had a controversial goofy charm. \n- Michael Keaton: After 20 years of Adam West, Michael Keaton changed the role forever. Although people didn\u2019t believe he was right for the job, after the first film came out, the masses were mad at Keaton as \n   Batman. \n- Kevin Conroy: Technically the most accurate Batman to date, Kevin Conroy gave Batman the voice every actor has used since. \n- Val Kilmer: Though some say that Val Kilmer was a good Batman, many felt as though he was no Michael Keaton and were unimpressed with the sudden change. \n- George Clooney: In 1997, George Clooney was nowhere near as famous as he is now, and while his role as Batman certainly didn\u2019t hurt his career, it also didn\u2019t do anything to further it as everyone who watched it \n   seemed to hate it. \n- Christian Bale: By the time Christian Bale came into the role, audiences didn\u2019t expect much from Batman actors. And although his bat voice was considered imperfect in many ways, Bale\u2019s rendition of the character \n   generally got better reviews than most of the others who took on the role. \n- Will Arnett: Most people don\u2019t realize that Will Arnett played Batman in The LEGO Movie, but those who did see him in the role absolutely loved his comedic take on the superhero. \n- Ben Affleck: When word got out that Ben Affleck was to play Batman in the new film Batman vs. Superman, audiences were hesitant to get excited. However, the general consensus now is that Affleck excelled in the \n   role due to his rugged good looks and charm. \n- Robert Pattinson: Playing the role very differently than anyone before, Pattinson made Batman the strange orphan he actually was, and once again, although no one thought he would excel in the role, he surprised \n   bat-fans everywhere with his take on the character.

Set boundaries with gratitude and appreciation - It isn't disrespectful to set boundaries, but you should still set them, and your parents should respect them. You can set boundaries and avoid possible hurt feelings by wording what you say carefully and sharing that you appreciate them,\n2. Be direct - It can be hard to get your parents to recognize that you're independent. This especially goes if you have moved back in with them. You can try to evade possible conflict by not saying anything, But, it's better to share your concerns rather than conceal them.\n3. Be clear - Being vague also doesn't help. When you set boundaries, you should be clear with your parents. This makes sure that they understand exactly what you mean. If they aren't getting it you can give them examples of things they've done that have upset you and tell them other things they can do instead.\n4. Compromise - Stating your boundaries can gently remind your parents that you make your own choices. If your boundaries aren't working for them, you should find some sort of compromise. If your parents ask inappropriate questions about your relationships, you can let them know it's okay to chat about your relationships but not go into a territory that's uncomfortable for you.

How quickly you react to events in video games depends on your hand-eye coordination. Hand-eye or eye-hand coordination refers to your eyes and hands working simultaneously to solve your situation. You can improve your hand-eye coordination by playing sports, playing more video games, practicing juggling, playing cornhole, painting, or any activity requiring you to use your hands and eyes simultaneously.\n2) Practice your aim. Aiming is a big part of most games. FPS games are extremely popular, and they rely heavily on aiming. You can practice aiming by playing custom games against AIs, using practice ranges, and changing your settings to match your play style better.\n3) Fix your crosshair. Everyone has a different play style. To understand yours better, try experimenting with the crosshair you use. Changing your crosshair will improve your aim and help you become a better gamer.\n4) Learn more about the game. Whatever games you're playing, you need to understand them. You cannot improve at the game if you don't know why certain actions are good or bad. For example, if you died, analyze why you died. Was it bad positioning? Were you not listening closely enough? You'll become a better gamer by analyzing the game and learning more about the ins and outs of it,\n5) Discover your strengths and weaknesses. Every gamer has strengths and weaknesses, no matter what game they're playing. Some players are naturally gifted at aiming, while others are not. Some gamers are gifted with game sense, while others are not. Determine what your strengths and weaknesses are, and work on your weaknesses.

Cerulean blue, for instance, is a favorite because it reminds most people of the oceans. Whereas, purple is often symbolic of luxury, which many people associate with a plush and cozy bedroom environment. \n\nHowever, color therapy is different for everyone, and the trick is finding colors that are soothing and calming specifically to you. It can be any color that evokes a peaceful brain response. While you don\u2019t have to flood your bedroom with that singular color, a few splashes in pillows, blankets, and even on the walls could have a safe, comforting effect on your brain and body. \n\n2. What\u2019s your \u201cperfect storm\u201d for a good night\u2019s sleep? \n\nAs everyone\u2019s calm colors are different, so are everyone\u2019s ideas of an ideal sleep space. While some people love complete darkness and a cold bedroom with a fan on high throughout the year, others are happier and sleep better with a nightlight in a quiet room of warm, still air. It\u2019s a personal preference, often associated with the ways you slept growing up. Ergo, it could be a catalyst for better sleep and a calmer mind as an adult too. \n\nIt may take trial and error, but work on discovering the environment that is most conducive to your calm state of mind and a good night\u2019s rest. Once you\u2019ve found your \u201cperfect storm\u201d of peace, it should be easier to create a cozy, calm environment in the bedroom. \n\n3. Bring nature into the bedroom with crystals, a vase of flowers, or windowsill succulents. \n\nNature is balance, and finding balance in your bedroom could mean reminding yourself of the equilibrium found in nature. For instance, you could add greenery with windowsill succulents, or bring a bloom of color onto your nightstand with a fresh vase of flowers. \n\nInto the mystical side of nature? Crystals are symbolic of inner feelings and your psyche, so invest and display crystals that represent what you want. For instance, black tourmaline repels negative energies, while amethyst encourages good dreams and deeper sleep. \n\n4. Engage your senses with softness and soothing scents. \n\nCalmness and peace are felt across all of your senses, so engage in those before bedtime. You could, for example, invest in a sound machine for the gentle lull of ocean waves or a cacophony of cicadas and crickets to remind you of your childhood. You could also surround yourself with softness, like plush pillows and luxurious blankets atop crisp, clean sheets. \n\nAnother way to invite calm into your bedroom is with the right scents. Lavender is naturally soothing to the mind, while vanilla is a subtle, mellow fragrance that transports your brain back to simpler, peaceful times. \n\nYou don\u2019t have to douse your pillows and blankets but use a room spritz to liven the air or do the same with a candle. Just don\u2019t forget to blow out the candle before you doze off. \n\n5. The less clutter in your bedroom, the less clutter in your mind before bedtime. \n\nClutter of your safe space is clutter of your mind because when the clutter becomes too much, your brain will latch onto the worry and responsibility of eventually having to clean and organize everything cluttered. It\u2019s a thought that can keep you awake at night! \n\nUse your day to declutter and organize your bedroom. The less worry you give yourself, the better sleep you\u2019ll have, and the calmer your mind will be. Remember that the aim here is to create a haven for yourself. \n", "role": "assistant"}], "category": "Brainstorm"}

Creating a comic book can be a difficult but rewarding venture. Here are some things to consider when creating a new comic book:\n\n1. Protagonist/Antagonist - Who is the main character/villain of the story? Your characters can be anything you want them to be; they don't necessarily have to follow the tradition of being individuals with superpowers. For instance, you could create characters who are based on people like yourself, living an ordinary life and dealing with ordinary, relatable problems. Consider the works of Harvey Pekar (\"American Splendor\"), which showcase stories about ordinary people. Or, if you decide to write characters who follow the fantasy superhero trope, know who they are (origin, superpowers, and how they got them, etc.). Generally, your characters should be fleshed out completely.\n2. Story - A good story can be made from any situation, but generally, most stories follow a formula that has been used in storytelling for centuries (i.e., Man vs. Man, Man vs. Environment). You could also write an autobiographical story or a story about other people who have lived or are still living. Your story is as creative and compelling as you make it, and it does not have to adhere to any set rules as long as it tells a coherent story that is worth reading.\n3. Illustrations - Drawing comic book characters and scenery can be done by yourself by hand or digitally using programs found online. You can also hire someone to draw the comic books for you if you have no desire or artistic skill to do it on your own. When making the illustrations for your comic book, have a clear idea of what you want the drawings to convey and consider using drawing techniques that show actions taking place (e.g., using \"action lines\" to illustrate a person's punch wooshing by another person's face.)\n4. Format - You can decide to have either a printed comic book on paper or a digital comic book that can be distributed via email or an app. With either option, you will still adhere to the same aforementioned steps, but the approach to going through these steps may differ slightly. For instance, making a digital comic book will still require illustrations, but illustrating digital comics will require the use of programs (i.e., Adobe, Paint, et al.) whereas printed comic books require ink and paper. Also, printing a comic book will result in something you can hold with your own hands but can become torn or worn over time, whereas a digital comic book has no tactile feel to it but will never deteriorate.", "role": "assistant"}], "category": "Brainstorm"}

Reviews: Given that this is a fanzine and your fellow writers likely are not able to compete with the release schedule of a larger publication, your reviews could focus more on an in-depth analysis of elements you enjoyed or from your own personal perspective. There is less pressure as well to release your reviews concurrently with the release of the game. \n2. Retrospectives: Perhaps there are games that you have wanted to write about for a long time. As a fanzine, you are less constrained by a need to stay current with the games you cover.\n3. Modding Corner: Independently produced mods for games rarely get coverage by mainstream publications, so this is a niche that your fanzine might seek to fill.\n4. Predictions: As a fanzine, you likely do not have advanced knowledge or access to game previews, but you also lack any agreements to avoid discussing future content. As such your fanzine is free to make predictions or express hope for certain games or features to be released.\n5. Is it good now?: Another topic that fanzines may be better placed to discuss are games that were released to poor reviews, but through patches and additional content updates have become much improved, even though they have fallen behind the publicity cycle.", "role": "assistant"}], "category": "Brainstorm"}

Create a strong tone of voice - For good brand awareness, you need consistency. That shouldn't just be with your logo or brand colors,  but it should also be in the way you communicate with others and the words you use. You want consumers to be able to instantly recognize you even when your logo is not showing. Therefore having a strong tone of voice that resonates with your target audience is essential. \n\n2. Develop a Referral Program - Research suggests that 49% of consumers in the United States say their friends and family are their top sources of brand awareness. Therefore a referral program can be highly effective when you want to get the word out about your brand. The same worked for well-known brands such as Dropbox and Paypal when they got their start. \n\n3. Consider Using Influencer Marketing - When you have an influencer with a large following promoting your brand, you will instantly receive more brand awareness. But you don't have to depend on the most popular influencers on social media to get the word out. Micro-influencers who have smaller followings but focus on more niche topics can provide a substantial amount of help for companies looking to increase their brand awareness. \n\n4. Use Your Branding Everywhere You Can - Make good use of your logo and place it everywhere you can to get your customers familiar with it. Take a cue from Amazon and place your logo on your shipping material so that it is easy to recognize. It is a little extra touch that can go a long way when it comes to helping consumers remember your brand and your company. \n\n5. Make Good Use of SEO and Content Marketing - Search Engine Optimization and content marketing are two of the most helpful resources you have online when you want to raise brand awareness. But the rules and trends for these two things are always changing. So be sure to get caught up on the latest requirements for SEO and implement some new strategies into your website, blog, or social media content. ", "role": "assistant"}], "category": "Brainstorm"}

Write as someone who is familiar with being a dog owner and knows the stress of leaving their pets at home alone with the possibility of barking and being stressed all day. This will really attract attention to those who have anxiety about leaving their dogs and it is hard to get places because of the stress.

This is a quick \"HOW-TO\" that can be watched in 15 seconds or less. \n- Wednesday - Create a square image for a static social media post that includes your brand and logo on the image.

This will show a customer some brand values in a more subtle way than just stating them.  \n- Friday - Make another video clip similar to Tuesday, but film yourself physically using one of the products you sell. This will build trust and assign a familiar face to your brand online. \n- Saturday - Share a post from another pet-themed business that aligns with your values. Give some positive support and expert insight in a few sentences related to the topic in the post.

Appliances and equipment \nAlthough there is no single cause that leads to an accidental house fire, there are some common factors that can lead to the accidental eruption of a fire. Appliances and other electrical equipment are some of the leading causes of house fires. Any device that generates heat such as a stove, clothes dryer, or a space heater, or one that will heat up after extended use such as a computer, is a potential fire hazard for your home. Additionally, any cooking vessels left unattended are another frequent cause of house fires. \n\n2. Candles \nEvery candle will have a warning label that states \"A burning candle should never be left unsupervised\". However many people will light a scented candle and forget about it until they start to burn uncontrollably. Candle fires are most likely to occur on Christmas Day, New Year's Day, and Christmas Eve. \n\n3. Holiday decor \nCandles are not the only culprit that can lead to a tragic fire during the holiday season. Christmas tree lights and other decorations are also to blame. Live trees that are not watered properly and left to dry out are another easy target for a fire caused by the hot lights wrapped around them. \n\n4. Electrical systems and devices \nAny device you own that uses electric power can start a fire and overheated lighting equipment is at the very top of that list. Questionable electrical work within a home, poorly connected circuits, loose wires, and improper grounding all pose a serious threat to homeowners. \n\n5. Smoking \nAnother common cause of house fire is due to negligence while smoking. People will often fall asleep while smoking cigarettes, and by doing so they can set their chairs, bed, or couch on fire. This can easily result in a fatality and cause the entire house to burn down. Another avoidable issue related to smoking is caused by discarding ashes that are still hot into the trash where they could ignite. \n\n6. Chemicals and gasses \nHome fires can also be caused by sources of propane gas and natural gas. A sudden spark combined with a small leak could create a combustible situation. Improperly mixed household chemicals can also trigger combustion, which is why it's important to conduct this form of activity outside the home. \n\n7. Lightning \nLightning fires will most commonly occur during the summer months when afternoon or early evening storms are at their highest. Homes that are in heavily wooded areas are extremely vulnerable to lightning strikes and could set the surrounding area on fire as well. ", "role": "assistant"}], "category": "Brainstorm"}

Courgettes.\nCourgettes are an easy vegetable to grow at home. Start by planting in late May using the well-prepared ground. You should find that just one or two plants are enough to grow to produce for several weeks. \n\n2. Beetroot.\nBeetroot is a popular thing to grow in England. You can plant beetroot from late April all the way through July. Sow beetroot seeds about 5cm apart, and be sure to remove roots that are only half-grown to avoid them interfering with the rest. You don't have to waste these half-grown roots, as they can be used in small salads. \n\n3. Chillies. \nChilies pack a flavourful punch and are great to grow at home. Start by researching chilies that are a good flavor and heat for you. Simply plant them in a large tough and use a can to support the chilies as they grow. Once you have enough, you can also store them for a long time. \n\n4. Dwarf french beans. \nTo grow Dwarf french beans, plant in either open ground or a container. These beans should be planted from mid-May to early August. You don't need to support this crop, so they are pretty low maintenance. You should bear produce in around 3-4 weeks, so maintain a planting schedule every three weeks to ensure you never run out.\n\n5. Potatoes.\nPotatoes grow really easily in just a large pot or alternatively can be grown just as well in a large compost bag. It is as easy as adding potato seeds to a layer of compost and covering it with more compost. From there, just wait for leaves to appear, which you must cover again with more compost.\n\n6. Strawberries. \nStrawberries are extremely low maintenance, with a single crop growing fresh strawberries for up to 4 years. All you need to do is a small clean-up of the plant each spring. \n\n7. Radish.\nRadishes are one of the best and easiest crops to grow at home. Radishes grow extremely quickly, too, which is a great way to start growing at home before moving on to higher-maintenance produce. ", "role": "assistant"}], "category": "Brainstorm"}

Take a Nap with Music: Did you know that listening to music while napping can aid in memory retention? So, why not try it out while learning guitar? Play some guitar music softly in the background while you nap and give your brain a rest as it processes the new information.\n\n5. Meditate for Mastery: Meditation has been proven to increase focus and reduce anxiety. Before picking up your guitar, take a few moments to meditate and clear your mind. The focus gained from this practice will make playing guitar a breeze.\n\n6. Create the Ideal Environment: Learning guitar can be more challenging in a noisy or cluttered environment. Optimize your learning surroundings by practicing in a quiet and organized space with good lighting. You can then focus solely on learning without distractions.\n\n7. Hit the Gym: Believe it or not, working out regularly can enhance your guitar-playing abilities! Utilize exercises that improve finger strength and dexterity, such as grip trainers and wrist curls.

Jams (jeans shorts), leotards, spandex and jelly shoes are great items of apparel.\n3. Movies and television shows - Get some LCD flat-screen TVs (or even \"old school\" CRT tube televisions) and play popular 80s movies and televisions on them (Miami Vice, The Breakfast Club, St. Elmo's Fire).\n4. Lingo - If you look the part, you should also speak the part. That means using the language and slang of the 1980s. Use words and phrases such as \"gnarly\", \"tubular\", \"awesome\" and \"radical\". Greet your attendees with a high five and a \"How's it hanging?\" and \"Sick dude!\"\n5. Games - You can play games with the other attendees that were very popular back in the 80s, including Twister and Parcheesi. Or, if you are feeling adventurous, rent some arcade machines like Pac-Man or pinball and place them in the venue for attendees to have hours of fun!", "role": "assistant"}], "category": "Brainstorm"}

Give Your Students More Choices - Young kids don't get to make very many decisions about what they're doing, for how long and where. This is true both at home and at school. Sometimes it can be fun and exciting for them to have a say in what's going on. When kids can choose an activity, choose where they want to sit in the classroom or pick out a toy to play with, it helps to make their lessons more fun while allowing them to learn decision-making skills. \n2. Incorporate Games with Learning - Games will always make learning more fun and they add instant engagement to any lesson plan. Whether you are reviewing answers for a test or going over memorization drills, games do not require a lot of preparation or expense. There are thousands of tutorials for free games you can play in the classroom online. \n3. Get Moving - Most kids don't like to sit still in the classroom for long periods. Incorporating movement into the classroom can improve engagement dramatically. You can dedicate 10 to 15 minutes at least once or twice a day to short physical activities such as dancing or playing games that will encourage your students to get up and move around. \n4. Incorporate Opportunities for Hands-On Learning - Teachers have relied on hands-on activities inside the classroom for many years and they have always helped improve the morale of their students. Hands-on (or active) learning will put students in control. Unlike traditional lecture-style lessons, these activities encourage students to produce original nights and ideas, which pushes them to deeper thought levels.

Start by braiding three small strands at the crown of the head and gradually add more and more hair to each strand, securing the braid to the scalp along the way. You can also part your hair in the center and do this twice for French braided pigtails.\n- 4 stranded braid: It takes a bit of practice to get the hang of this style, but it\u2019s nearly as easy as a standard braid with a more interesting look, plus it tends to be sturdier for those whose hair falls out of braids easily. \n- Half up: Take the top section of your hair and keep it up with a claw clip, a ponytail, or a small warrior\u2019s knot; meanwhile let the bottom section of your hair hang loose.\n- Style with a headband or scarf: Leave your hair loose but brush it back so that there is no visible part.

This style is similar to a French braid except it\u2019s woven from one temple To the other rather than straight back from the crown of the head.\n-  Twisted halo: This style works best with curly or textured hair. Twist locks to weave them into a halo around your head, using Bobby pins to hold the twist in place. You can do this as a full updo or use just the top section of your hair for a half-down version.\n- Ponytail flip: Style your hair in a loose, low ponytail, then pull it into two symmetrical sections, creating a hole just above the elastic. Filter the long end of your ponytail through that hole once or twice to create a twist. This can also be done as a half-down style.\n- Space buns: part your hair into two even sections and secure both as high ponytails on each side of the head. Twist these into buns and hold them in place with pins. These can be tightly woven knots or loose for a wispier style.", "role": "assistant"}], "category": "Brainstorm"}

There are many side hustles you can do both in person and virtually if you'd like to earn extra money or develop a passive income. Here are some ideas for things you could do on the side to make money while still working a traditional day job:\n\n1. Edit Videos. Oftentimes brands need to produce promotional materials but don't necessarily have the time or expertise to do it in-house, so they hire freelancers to edit video content. \n2. Sell NFTs. Non-fungible tokens are used to buy and sell products online. If you have something creative to sell, NFTs can be a great way to turn a steady profit. \n3. Be a social media manager. Many companies or small businesses need a social media presence but don't necessarily want to deal with posting and coming up with good content all of the time. This is why many businesses will hire someone else to do this for them. \n4. Be a virtual assistant. This is a straightforward side hustle that can be done from anywhere. \n5. House sit. Housesitting is an industry in itself where people that have second homes or go on vacation but want someone to look after their space, including pets and plants, hire other people to do so. \n6. Teach a language. You don't necessarily have to be bilingual to teach your native language to others, and this can be done virtually or in person. \n7. Rent out your space. Airbnb has made it super simple and profitable to rent out your spare room or your entire home if you aren't using it. \n8. Sell products on Etsy. These can be physical products or digital designs like branding or spreadsheets, for example. \n9. Drive for a rideshare company. If you have a car, driving for Uber or Lyft in your downtime or on the weekends is a great way to earn money on the side. \n10. Deliver food. Depending on where you live, delivering food through Postmates or Deliveroo can be a substantial side hustle and you don't even need a car. \n11. Write an e-book. Since it's possible to self-publish, there's no downside to creating an e-book on a topic you're familiar with and selling it on Amazon. \n12. Create an online course. This is another thing that may require a good amount of work upfront, but can eventually turn into a passive income. ", "role": "assistant"}], "category": "Brainstorm"}

Switch to LED Lights \nAlthough LED lights may cost more than traditional light bulbs, they will help you save tons of money on your energy costs over time. Switching to LED bulbs is an excellent way to conserve energy and save on your electric bill. LED lights will not just help you save on your energy bill, but they can also help you save money on your overall lighting costs since they last at least 25 times longer than traditional bulbs. That means you will not need to replace your light bulbs as often. \n\n2. Do Not Leave Your Refrigerator Door Open \nWe all look inside our fridge as we decide what we want to eat. But did you know that doing so can cause you to waste a lot of energy? It takes more time for your refrigerator to cool back down after the doors have been open for several minutes. To eliminate this extra cost, try deciding on what you want to eat before you open your fridge doors to help reduce the amount of energy used. \n\n3. Keep Your Oven Door Closed \nIf you frequently open your oven door while cooking, it will take twice as long to get back to the cooking temperature. Instead of opening your oven door all the time, consider using an oven light if your oven has a window on the door that allows you to peek inside. \n\n4. Shut Down your Electronics \nOne of the easiest things you can do to help save on energy costs is to shut down your electronics when they are not in use. We all tend to leave our devices such as our TV and laptop on making it more convenient than waiting for it to boot up again. But leaving your devices on while they are not in use can contribute to your high energy costs. When we leave devices plugged into an outlet, they are still using power. This is something known as \"phantom power\". To help reduce your energy use and costs, try connecting everything to a power bar and turning that off whenever you leave the house. \n\n5. Decrease Energy Use During Peak Hours \nThese days, many homes are now equipped with smart meters that keep track of when you are using the most energy throughout the day. If you are interested in conserving energy, you should use most of your electricity during non-peak hours. By doing so, you will save as much as 10 cents per kilowatt. \n\n6. Make Use of Small Appliances \nIf you are cooking a small meal, you will want to make good use of your smaller appliances instead of firing up your large electric oven. Toaster ovens, electric skillets, air fryers, and other countertop appliances are now versatile enough to help you create a full-course meal without using a ton of energy. \n\n7. Wash Laundry in Cold Water Only \nIf you have any delicate items in your wardrobe, you may already know about the benefits of washing your clothes in cold water. Doing so can help your clothing last longer and the fabric is less likely to shrink. Another great benefit of using cold water while doing laundry is that it will help keep your electricity bill low. It is estimated that as much as 90% of the energy used by your washing machine is spent on heating your water. Therefore, many consumers have caught on to the benefits of using cold water to wash their laundry. ", "role": "assistant"}], "category": "Brainstorm"}

Show me a numbered list of tips to follow to make the move easier mentally and physically.", "role": "user"}, {"content": "Transitioning from your childhood bedroom to a college dorm can make you feel overwhelmed and scared. Hopefully, the following four tips will help you make a smoother shift from home to a college living situation. \n\nCongratulations on making the big move toward an independent future! \n\n1. Ask your family, friends, and loved ones for help. \n\nYou\u2019ll probably need physical help making the move to college, but you\u2019ll also need support and emotional help. For many college newbies, it\u2019s not easy to leave the familiarity of a childhood home but knowing that you have the emotional support and love of those that you care about can give you a much-needed confidence boost and lessen your doubt or anxieties. \n\n2. Sharing a dorm? Be open-minded as to who your roommate may be. \n\nWhile you can request a specific type of dorm room, it\u2019s not often that you can request a specific type of roommate. So, be open-minded and respectful of whoever you\u2019ve been paired with. You\u2019ll be spending a lot of time together in the same space, so you must establish a cordial rapport from the start. If you and your roommate have too many differences, you can always request a transfer later in the school year. \n\n3. Pack the essentials, but save d\u00e9cor and organizational extras for after you\u2019ve moved in. \n\nToiletries, clothes, and comfort items, like a favorite blanket, are all essential for any college student on move-in day. Otherwise, everything else is extra that can wait until you\u2019ve settled into your dorm room. \n\nDon\u2019t overload the car with things that you don\u2019t need right away. There are stores and shops galore in college towns, so it should be easy to find any d\u00e9cor or organizational tools that you may need after you\u2019ve officially transitioned from home to college. \n\n4. Anxious? Arrive on campus earlier than everyone else to ensure you don\u2019t get caught in the move-in rushes. \n\nAnxiety is the biggest problem for most new college students, especially because they don\u2019t want to feel dumb or make a fool of themselves on the first day around everyone else. It\u2019s a common fear, and one that\u2019s typically unfounded, particularly when everyone is worried about the same things. \n\nHowever, you can lessen your anxiety by planning on earlier arrivals. If you\u2019ve packed only the essentials, it should be easy for you to find your room and get settled in before the other students make a mad dash to do the same. The general rule of thumb for anxious students is to arrive two to three hours before the move-in rushes.", "role": "assistant"}], "category": "Brainstorm"}

Here are some with noted health benefits:\n\n\u2022 Mint: Mint's powerful smell can help combat any undesirable coup fumes and also keep insects at bay. In addition, it can encourage new feather growth in chickens and has been said to have a calming effect. (Calmer hens equals more eggs!) It can even be served fresh, frozen, or dried, and obviously has many household uses, as well. Because mint is a prolific grower, it's safe to plant near the coup. If it spreads inside, the chickens can trim the excess without harming the overall supply.\n\n\u2022 Lavender: Lavender is calming for chickens and humans alike! In addition, it has a lovely smell that mixes well with mint and other herbs. This smell helps dispel pests. Lavender is also good for the circulatory system, increasing blood flow when hens might not be moving around as much (during winter, cold snaps, or when sitting on eggs.) The seed-shaped flowers of lavender are also enjoyable for chickens to forage, providing some mental exercise.\n\n\u2022 Oregano: Oregano's smell deters pests and mixes wonderfully with the basil and tomatoes in your garden (which chickens also love!) Oregano grows best when harvested often, so whole springs can be hung in your coup for the chickens to pick at and scavenge. It's a natural antibiotic that's full of vitamins and antioxidants. You can even add dried oregano into your feed for these benefits, although it won't be as potent as fresh sprigs. \n\n\u2022 Thyme: Thyme, like the others, is aromatic and mixes wonderfully with the smell of lavender. (Just check your soap scents!) Like oregano, thyme is a natural antibiotic that also aids in respiratory stability. Thyme spreads, like mint, so it's safe to plant near the coup and let the chickens control the excess. It can be hung in full sprigs like oregano or dried. \n\nAdditionally, any of these herbs can be soaked in vinegar and used as an all-natural pest control due to their aromatics.

Blogging - While there are a lot of people who blog professionally as their main source of income, there are also some who blog just for fun. You can start a blog on any topic you are interested in. You can make it humorous, or write about a serious topic you are passionate about. You are not pressured to follow a particular schedule or format and you may end up connecting with others who share you same interests through your blog. \n\n2. Reading - Grabbing a book and reading for hours may already be a favorite pastime for many people, but if you haven't picked up a book in a while and you are looking for a good way to pass the time, reading is an excellent option. Studies show that just a few minutes of reading something you enjoy can lower your stress levels by as much as 60 percent. \n\n3. Learning a new language - There are a few hobbies out there that can be as useful in today's world as learning a new language. And if you are good enough at it, you could even find ways to use your new skill in your professional life as well. Or you could simply enjoy being able to communicate with locals on your next vacation. \n\n4. Journaling - While keeping a diary or journal may seem like something you would only do in your younger years, journaling has been known to be extremely therapeutic and helpful. Trends such as hand lettering or bullet journaling have made keeping a journal these days a fun and functional work of art and there are many tutorials out there that can show you ways to journal more effectively. \n\n5. Staying Informed on Current Events - Yes, staying up to date on current news and world happenings can be a hobby. If you would like to stay in the know but do not want to get bogged down by negativity, you can choose to have free daily briefs sent to your email or smartphone device. These quick and shortened blurbs of information will provide you with your daily news stories without all the unnecessary drama. \n\n6. Gardening - Few hobbies are as rewarding as gardening. You get to spend time outdoors in the fresh air, care for and nurture your plants and watch them grow into thriving flowers or fruits and vegetables for you to enjoy. All it takes to get started are a few seeds soil, fertilizers, and a few basic gardening tools. If you are new to gardening, growing a few herbs or flowers in a pot is a great way to start. \n\n7. Hiking - Hiking is another great hobby that costs nothing and will benefit you in more ways than one. If you love nature and being outdoors, you will love going out and exploring hiking trails at your local park or other fun destinations. Hiking can help you mentally by reducing stress while helping you physically at the same time. You can find simple, low-impact hiking trails for beginners or expert trails with inclines and rugged terrain if you are up to the challenge. \n\n8. Camping - Another excellent hobby for anyone who loves the great outdoors is camping. You don't have to go to extremes and spend a lot of money to enjoy camping. You can go with the basic supplies and have just as much, if not more, fun than those who go camping in large exquisite tents or RVs. ", "role": "assistant"}], "category": "Brainstorm"}

Here are some basic dress code ideas that could work to give your employees a cohesive look:\n\n-Basic black: Wear black from head to toe.\n-Black and white: Wear black pants or shorts with a white top.\n-Canadian tuxedo: Though people sometimes mock this as a civilian fashion choice, pairing a denim top with blue jeans can be a stylish look.\n-Primary colors: Pair blue jeans with red, yellow, or blue tee shirts.\n-Head-to-toe color: Maybe your restaurant\u2019s interior prominently features a color that isn\u2019t black, white, or primary, like teal or orange. You can have your employees wear a top in this color or dress in it from head to toe.\n-Business casual: Your employees could all wear polo shirts and khaki bottoms for a unified but diverse look.\u00a0\n-Standardized pattern: Your employees could all wear plaid flannel tops, gingham prints, tie-dye, stripes, polka dots, paisley, or floral patterns. They could also wear more whimsical patterns if they\u2019re on brand for your restaurant, such as Hawaiian shirts for tropical island cuisine or ugly holiday sweaters for an eatery serving comfort food in the last months of the year.\n-Signature aprons: It may not be sensible to purchase full uniforms for your staff, but custom aprons could make a less expensive and more practical alternative. They would not need to be tailored to each employee\u2019s individual size, so the staff members could share from a collective pool of clean aprons in much the same way they\u2019d share resources like napkins and trays. You'd just need to pay to have the aprons laundered in bulk every few days.\u00a0\n-Standardized accessory: You could allow employees to wear whatever they\u2019re most comfortable in, but have everyone wear the same accessory to make them easy for patrons to pick out of a crowd. This accessory could be a colorful hat, scarf, or necktie, among other options, but for visibility to customers, it\u2019s a good idea to choose something worn above waist level.\n-Theme costume: If your restaurant\u2019s menu lends itself to a specific theme\u2014for example, a prohibition-era speakeasy, a Mexican cantina, or a 1950s-style diner\u2014you could ask your staff to dress in relevant costumes of their own choosing.

There are a few different pranayama exercises that are recommended for beginners:\n\n- Ujjayi pranayama involves exhaling with an open mouth, feeling the breath moving across your throat, and imagining you are fogging up a glass with your breath by gently constricting the throat. As you become more comfortable with this style of breathing, you can try closing your mouth and inhaling and exhaling through your nose.\n\n- Sama Vritti Pranayama, or box breathing, involves inhaling for a count of 4, holding for 4, exhaling for 4, and again holding for 4. This cycle can be repeated for a few minutes. It should help you feel calm and relaxed. \n\n- Dirgha pranayama, commonly referred to as three-part breath, involves quickly stopping your inhalations and exhalations with short pauses. It involves inhaling until one-third of the lung's capacity is filled, then pausing for 2-3 seconds. Then inhale another third and pause for 2-3 seconds. Lastly, inhale until the lungs are completely filled. Then repeat this same pattern on the exhale. ", "role": "assistant"}], "category": "Brainstorm"}

Ability to pay on credit. \nSometimes you don't have enough money to pay for something, but you really need it. A credit card lets you purchase a product as soon as you want and then pay off the balance over time. Certain situations can be highly beneficial, such as expensive emergencies or wanting to spread the costs of a large purchase over time. \n\n2. Most accepted payment method. \nRetailers almost universally accept credit cards. This means you can carry one card around instead of constantly withdrawing cash. Visa and Mastercard are the largest payment processors for credit cards, and you will find that they are accepted almost everywhere in the world. This is an excellent benefit if you travel a lot and don't want to keep track of currencies. \n\n3. Interest-free cash withdrawals.\nSome credit cards allow users to withdraw large amounts of cash without paying interest for up to 45 days. This can be extremely useful in emergencies. \n\n4. Reward points. \nCredit cards often give users reward points for using their cards. This means you get extra value on your purchases simply by using a credit card. Certain credit cards offer specific rewards for specific spending categories giving users a bonus for spending money, for example, on travel. These rewards are often limitless, which gives customers an excellent opportunity to get maximum value from the card. \n\n5. Insurance. \nCredit cards offer significant security measures such as insurance. Having personal accident coverage and travel insurance just for having a credit card is a massive benefit that entices credit card users. As well as this, credit cards also offer a sense of security as users are often able to get refunds on transactions that they did not receive a product or in instances where the product was not as described. \n\n6. Make travel easy. \nSome credit cards give you great travel benefits. As well as not worrying about organizing local currency, some credit cards offer discounts on flights, dining out, and hotels. Credit cards sometimes offer reward bonuses for money spent on travel. Sometimes, your credit card can give you priority access to airport lounges and other areas.\n\n7. Discount and cashback. \nSimilar to rewards, credit cards offer users exceptional discounts for spending at preferred stores and sometimes offer money back as cashback. Money for free is a great benefit of using a credit card.\n\n8. Improve your credit score. \nIf you want to buy a house or secure a loan, you must have a strong credit history and rating. A credit card improves your credit score by showing you can be trusted to repay your borrowed money. Along with smaller bills like phone and tv subscriptions, this is the best way to build a credit history. \n\n9. Safety. \nNot having to carry cash around can make you feel a lot safer. A credit card allows you to carry just one card and have far more money than cash. \n\n10. Keep track of expenses. \nIf you regularly use cash to pay for things, tracking your expenses can be difficult without much effort. Using a credit card will mean receiving monthly statements outlining every transaction. This makes it much easier to see where your money is spent and make informed decisions regarding your spending.

Sorry, Monopoly, and Chutes and Ladders are classics, while UNO and Yahtzee provide a little something different. Don\u2019t forget about tabletop role-playing games for older family members!\n\n- Arts and crafts. There are lots of things that can be made with regular household objects. Get some paper, school glue, and some scissors and make collages. Or get some pipe cleaners and make stick figures. Find some googly eyes and glue them to a clothespin. Use your imagination; you are bound to find some old items that can be repurposed for a fun piece of art.\n\n- Build a blanket and pillow fort. This is great for the little ones - they seem to love places to play hide and seek and you can get creative with bed pillows, couch throw pillows, blankets, sheets, and whatever else you can find. You can make this into a fun way to watch a movie or binge some family TV shows.\n\n- Have a talent show. Sing a song, make up a silly dance, or tell some dad jokes. Take turns and see who can come up with the craziest character or most original dance. Add some music and turn it into a fun karaoke party! \n\n- Make some tasty treats. Nothing beats rainy fun than eating some treats that you made for yourself. Cookies and brownies are easy staples that the kids can help with, while older folk may experiment with more decadent treats like chocolate mousse or a no-bake cheesecake.

This will be concerning my pay.", "role": "user"}, {"content": "Here are five tips to use when negotiating your pay. \n\n1. Know your worth.\nBefore entering negotiations regarding your pay, you must know what you are worth. Knowing what you are worth to a company will give you a base for negotiations. It can be tough to see what you are worth to your company, but luckily, you can use sites like glassdoor.com and payscale.com to get a better idea of what people in similar roles and companies to you do earn. This knowledge will mean you can confidently suggest a number in line with the market rate. Offering a rate identical to others in your field will allow you to have confidence that the company will not be able to find someone better without at least paying an equal rate. Hiring new staff is often tedious and not cost-effective, so forcing your employer into this decision can work in your favor. \n\n2. Use good timing. \nTiming is everything in negotiations, which is never more true than in salary negotiations. Utilizing good timing can be the difference between a successful salary negotiation and an awkward conversation with your boss. Try to initiate salary negotiations while the company is doing well and you are being seen to impact that success substantially. A salesman who isn't hitting targets regularly would be ill-advised to open negotiations regarding salary. It may be that they can get a higher wage but unlikely to be sufficient if they don't have the data to back up their claimed performances. If you've just completed a profitable project and been a key player, it's probably a great time to strike while the iron is hot and ask for a pay rise. \n\n3. Be realistic.\nIt is necessary to know your worth and understand your value to a company, but remaining realistic is also pivotal. If you aim for the stars and ask for 50% more than you are worth, you can expect your employer to grow frustrated and unsympathetic to your request. The better tactic is to have a number in mind you would like, then add a small % to it so that you can work down to your ideal number. This will allow your employer some wiggle room to negotiate and feel they are not being played. It is essential to back your realistic request up with why you deserve it and what others are getting. \n\n4. Don't ask too often. \nAs stated above, alienating and frustrating your employer is not a good idea. If you do this, you risk no negotiations and just a simple no. This will leave you in no better position than you were before. That is precisely why it is essential not to ask too frequently for a pay rise. Think of a similar situation in the car when a child asks the parents are we there yet over and over. The parents become frustrated and eventually will stop answering. The same will happen with your employer. They will revert to a standard no answer if you continuously ask for something. Instead, be sure to research what you are worth and strike while the iron is hot, as we described in point 2. \n\n5. Don't be afraid to ask. \nIt seems silly to put this point straight after point 4. However, the fact is valid and should be discussed. While asking too often is not advised, not asking at all will probably get you nowhere. While this can't be said for all companies, most are reluctant to hand out pay raises regularly and will wait until they are asked or forced. That's why it is crucial that if you feel you deserve a pay rise and the circumstances dictate one, you stand up for yourself and ask. The worst thing they can say is no. If you don't think you deserve a pay raise, that's fine. Don't ask till you do. But if you have been stuck at the same rate for years and are integral to our company's operations, then speak up and ask for your worth. \n", "role": "assistant"}], "category": "Brainstorm"}

Litecoin (LTC) - Litecoin is a bitcoin alternative that's gotten quite popular. Litecoin has a Bitcoin-compatible API and a quick-running blockchain. You can mine Litecoin using the Scrypt algorithm which is memory and compute-intensive. It also can't be mined by Bitcoin's API chips.\n2. Ethereum (ETH) - Russian-founded Ethereum is an application platform that puts storage resources across the internet, and it's similar to peer-to-peer streaming services. The resources on Ethereum are paid by Ether, which is the cryptocurrency the platform is named after. Ethereum allows for contracts built into its software DNA, and the currency pays out when conditions are met. You can mine Ether with Ethereum's resources, and it is possible for the cryptocurrency to go through inflation.\n3. Ripple (XRP) - The Ripple cryptocurrency is controlled by Ripple Labs Inc, which is connected to the banking industry. Ripple has been taken on by large banking companies such as Bank of America and UPS, and it's used in securing transactions internationally. Ripple comes with low transaction fees and a high speed.\n4. Zcash (Zec) - Bitcoin transactions are on public record, but Zcash is a private currency. It has a \"zero-knowledge\" security implementation, which makes it a safe option. It also works with a blockchain mechanism that doesn't link old and current transactions. Zcash can be mined with a gaming GPU.\n5. Dash (DASH) - The name dash comes from the words digital and cash, and it used to be called Xcoin and then Darkcoin. This litecoin works with almost instant transaction speeds, and its money transfers are private. Dash isn't actually governed by humans, and its contract is actually encoded into its program.", "role": "assistant"}], "category": "Brainstorm"}

Below, I have written seven tips for writing a standout CV.\n\n1. Start strong. \nStart your CV by listing your best achievements to date. Highlight your skills and experience, and just champion yourself. The goal of a CV is to convince a potential employer you are the right fit for them, so don't be shy and tell them exactly why your skills and experience will assist their company. If you don't get this bit right, it is unlikely recruiters will get much further into your CV. \n\n2. Emphasize past results rather than responsibilities. \nWhen detailing your work history, try to avoid discussing what you were responsible for and instead highlight your actual results. It is far more meaningful for someone to see results rather than try to infer what you have achieved through roles and responsibilities. It sounds better to say, \"I ensured the completion of 5 major projects within my time at the company,\" rather than, \"In my role, I was responsible for major projects.\"\n\n3. Customise. \nOne CV does not fit all jobs. Try to tailor your CV to the job you are applying for, and bring to the fore the experiences that suit the role and company you are applying to. Research the company to understand who they are, then tailor your CV to match its ethos and culture.\n\n4. Highlight growth and change. \nChange is good, and growth is even better. If you have been promoted or changed roles at a previous company, mention that. Recruiters will take that as you are versatile and willing to learn. This will give them affirmation from the actions of your previous employer that you were both competent and proactive. \n\n5. Demonstrate your network. \nShowcase that if you have a large network and are well connected. Employers will see that as an opportunity to hire you and get the added bonus of your well-established network as a resource. If you are hired, they get two for the price of one. \n\n6. Show industry insight. \nIt doesn't hurt to give a small opinion if you are applying to an industry that's currently topical or experiencing changes. Doing this shows you are current, in the know, and committed to your career in this industry. You don't have to give an opinion. You could forecast a change you foresee and mention how you see this impacting a role. \n\n7. Use powerful words. \nA CV is extremely important in grabbing a recruiter's attention. Using powerful words like implemented and adaptable will help you stand out from the crowd and keep your CV in the prospects' file. Consider the difference in the sentences \"I am willing to change\" and \"I am very adaptable\" one seems weak, and one seems far stronger. You can research topical power words online or use the thesaurus feature in Microsoft word to make your language stand out. ", "role": "assistant"}], "category": "Brainstorm"}

Faults are considered when a pole is dismantled, the rider goes off from the way, or if the rider takes too much time on the course than the required allocated time.\n\n2.

{"prompt": "Give me a list of things to consider when trying to identify my target audience. I own a tech company and am trying to get more brand awareness.", "prompt_id": "95cbf9271dee3eed788d227018607b49d21fe9108ff117cb10c2912ad8d0bd33", "messages": [{"content": "Give me a list of things to consider when trying to identify my target audience. I own a tech company and am trying to get more brand awareness.", "role": "user"}, {"content": "Here are eight things to consider when identifying your target audience. \n\n1. Analyze current customers.\nIf you are in a position where you have existing customers, then a good first step is to identify traits and characteristics among them. Think about the demographic they belong to and why they may be purchasing products or services from you already. You may already have data regarding your current customer's ages, locations, and vocations. These are all valuable metrics to track and interpret when defining your target audience. \n\n2. Market research.\nConducting market research is a valuable process. By conducting market research, you can identify areas in which you may be able to grow an audience or a blind spot where your services could be of real value. Looking into your competitors can provide great insights into what works and doesn't and where services like yours perform well. Knowing what others offer gives you an advantage when creating a unique selling point that sets you apart. \n\n3. Industry trends. \nKeeping your finger on the pulse and identifying what changes are occurring within your industry allows you to tailor content and services in a way that provides real value. This leads on from market research slightly and is another way of ensuring you stay informed concerning your customers' expectations and desires. This will allow you to provide them with a constant value.  \n\n4. Distinguish benefits from features. \nBenefits and features are fundamentally different things. It is important to clarify this to your target audience. It is excellent that you have a feature or product that can help them in some way, but it's even better if you can explain the practical benefit of the feature. Take, for example, a product that improves productivity. Emphasizing productivity improvement and what that means is more important than highlighting the actual feature that does the work. People are more interested in what you will enable them to do rather than how you will do it. \n\n5. Spy on your competition. \nJust as important as your customers are your competitors. Keep an eye on what they are doing and the content they are producing. What could be working for them, and what could you do to improve what they have? This is an easy way to gain inspiration and see what's not being offered. This will allow you to fill in the gaps and potentially convert customers to you and your services. If your competition produces content about something you are not, this may mean they have researched and identified a weak spot. Now you can do your own research and improve on what they have done. \n\n6. Who isn't your target audience?\nKnowing who your target audience is made much easier if you can identify exactly who it isn't. Who won't benefit from what you are offering or take an interest in what you are saying? By analyzing these questions, you can reduce your audience to specifics and tailor your services to those likely to benefit from and purchase them. Doing this will give you more time to concentrate on those that matter. \n\n7. Be objective. \nMaking assumptions can lead to alienating some of your customer base. This can be avoided by posting content that leads by facts more than anything else. By being objective, you show your customers you can be trusted and only care about black and white. This should help to foster a sense of trust in you and your products. \n\n8. Go niche. \nIt may seem like going to a niche would limit your customers, and while that may be true to an extent, you shouldn't underestimate how many people are in the world. And also how being a leading figure in a super niche topic can grow your audience quickly and lead you to be the go-to person in said niche. Also, it is worth remembering that while your niche may mean fewer customers or audiences, it also means less competition. \n", "role": "assistant"}], "category": "Brainstorm"}

From finding the best routes to get you to your destination faster, to advanced telemetrics that can assist with keeping your sensitive materials at the right temperature, this system enables better efficiency within your business to allow your company to operate more professionally and help you gain more profits. \n\n2. Fewer Billing and Paycheck Issues \nSlow-paying clients and incorrect paychecks due to human error can do severe damage to your turnover rate. When you use a TMS program, it can help guarantee your drivers are paid accurately and on time.  These programs also provide the option to create statements that are straightforward and easy to understand. \n\n3. Improved Driver Analytics \nOwners of large fleets can learn a large amount of information from the data they collect from different sources. But, if you are unable to collect that data and present it in a way where everyone on your team can understand it, that information is useless to you. An efficient TMS system will produce the data you need in a clear and concise manner. It takes care of all the difficult work associated with gathering these details so you can focus on other areas of your business. ", "role": "assistant"}], "category": "Brainstorm"}

Here are some non-dairy post-workout supplement ingredients that you should consider adding to your regimen:\n\n1. Leucine: It\u2019s an essential amino acid that plays a key role in building and repairing muscle tissue after a workout. It also activates the body's protein synthesis pathway, allowing for optimal muscle growth. Leucine can be found in protein-rich foods such as meat, fish, and beans, but supplementing with it can help enhance muscle protein synthesis and promote muscle recovery.\n\n2. Creatine: Creatine is widely considered the most effective muscle-building supplement. It\u2019s a compound produced naturally in the body that helps produce ATP \u2013 the primary source of energy for muscle cells. In short, it can boost power and strength after your workouts, which would allow you to lift heavier weights and perform more reps afterward, ultimately leading to increased muscle mass.\n\n3. Beta-alanine: It\u2019s a non-essential amino acid, but it contributes to the production of carnosine, which acts as a buffer to prevent acid buildup in the muscles after your exercise. That, in turn, delays muscle fatigue and can improve future workout performance, particularly after high-intensity exercises such as weightlifting or sprinting.\n\n4. Spirulina: Spirulina is a nutrient-dense blue-green alga that is rich in protein, vitamins, and minerals, making it a popular supplement among athletes and fitness enthusiasts. It has also been shown to reduce inflammation in the body and enhance endurance. It would make a valuable addition to your post-workout regimen.\n\nIncorporating these supplements into your post-workout fitness routine can optimize muscle growth and recovery, improve workout performance, and enhance overall health and well-being.", "role": "assistant"}], "category": "Brainstorm"}

However, just one cup is packed with 220% of the daily recommended value of vitamin A, while also having 37% of the daily value of potassium and also 17% of the DV of fiber. They can be mixed into soups, salads, or sauteed and eaten as a side dish.\n\nAlthough these vegetables have been known to be eaten raw, cooking them by whatever means necessary may be helpful for people who have trouble digesting raw vegetables.

You might not need to speak to the person that triggered your anger in order to process it; talking to someone else can also be helpful, so long as you are working towards a constructive outcome rather than ruminating on your frustration. \n- Recognize your triggers to find better solutions: If you know that you get really worked up waiting in long lines, try to beat the crowds and run errands early, avoiding peak business hours. Or, if you have a co-worker who usually gets on your nerves, develop some strategies to minimize contact with them throughout the work day. Look for patterns in your anger and take a pragmatic approach to securing peace of mind. \n- Distract yourself:  If something happens that triggers your anger, look for a change of scenery.

There are many uses for them. Here is a list of ways to reuse your bags at least one more time before throwing them away:\n\n1. Line your small trash cans. Smaller trash cans such as the ones in the bathroom can be lined with plastic grocery bags, which helps to keep the can clean and odor-free.\n\n2. Use them as emergency trash bags for the car. Keep a handful of bags rolled up in the glove box so they're handy when you're out and need one.\n\n3. Use them as wet bags. Take a few plastic grocery bags with you the next time you visit the pool or beach. They can be great for keeping wet clothes and towels separate.\n\n4. Pack your shoes in them in suitcases. Instead of putting your shoes loosely in your suitcase, put them in a plastic grocery bag to keep the soles from dirtying your clean clothes.\n\n5. Pick up dog poop. Keep a handful handy for dog walks, and use plastic grocery bags instead of buying poop bags.\n\n6. Stuff some into your shoes and purses to help them to retain their shape. Ball up plastic grocery bags and stuff all the shoes and purses in your closet.\n\n7. Use them for packing and moving. You can wrap a few bags around breakables before packing them into boxes to protect them from breakage. \n\n8. Store paint brushes or rollers in them. When you're going to come back to your painting project, just put your wet brush or roller into a bag until later. \n\n9. Line a paint tray. Using a plastic bag to line your paint tray will make cleanup super easy when you're done.\n\n10. Line your cat's litter box. Having a plastic bag in the litter box makes cleaning out the box so much easier, eliminating the need to empty and wash it.  ", "role": "assistant"}], "category": "Brainstorm"}

Use a Trough Planter \nA raised garden bed is a natural choice for a vegetable garden using containers. By using a trough planter, you have a raised or standing height that allows users to harvest and tends to their crops easily without needing to hunch over or kneel. As well as being a practical gardening solution, trough planters also offer a great visual benefit for adding height to your pot. \n\n2. Adding Potted Crops will Bring Productivity to any Patio \nVegetable garden container ideas will give you the chance to increase your productivity on your patio. You can make use of your unused space and add a variety of crops such as tomatoes, beans, and pumpkins. And the great thing is you don't have to spend a lot of money on landscaping or dig up half your backyard for a fancy vegetable patch. Use your patio and seating space to add more symmetrical vibrance to your outdoor space. \n\n3. Grow Potatoes in a Bag \nPotatoes are one of the easiest and simplest vegetables to grow and they are best grown in containers. If they are grown in a border, potatoes will spread into all the available soil not just in a small section where they are planted. When potatoes are planted in the ground, it can be difficult to harvest all of the crops. Placing them in a bag or container, it makes it much easier to harvest everything so that nothing is wasted. \n\n4. Be Sure to Choose the Right Container \nAlong with complementing your garden when using plant containers, you must get the right containers that are compatible with the plants you are growing. your containers should be 4 inches wider and deeper than the root ball of the plant. Shallow containers that are around 12 to 16 inches deep are great for shallow-rooted herbs and other annual vegetables. You can replenish the soil for each season when you replant them. If you are interested in growing larger plants such as aubergines or tomatoes, you would do your best by using one plant per container. \n\n5. Design Raised Garden Bed Containers to Suit Your Outdoor Space \nRaised garden beds can make great vegetable garden containers if you have a large enough space to work with. The benefit of this is that you can have these containers made to fit your landscaping, no matter how large or small they need to be. There are many great materials out there to use for raised beds. One expert suggests using Corten steel due to its durability and capacity to be bent or folded into an unusual shape. The deep rust shade of the material is also very attractive and will look great with other materials like buff-colored gravel. ", "role": "assistant"}], "category": "Brainstorm"}

Setting the date within the next two weeks will give you adequate time to prepare yourself without reducing your motivation to go through with it. \n2. Tell your family, friends, and co-workers that you plan to quit. Not only will this help keep you accountable and on track to quit, but you will need the support and encouragement of your friends and family in order to follow through.\n3. Anticipate and plan for the challenges you'll face while quitting. Increase your chance of success by thinking of any likely challenges and creating a plan for how to manage them. By anticipating and planning for how you will deal with challenges such as nicotine withdrawal, you will be more likely to make it through those difficult moments without relapsing. \n4. Remove cigarettes from your home, car, and work. By completely removing cigarettes from your living and working areas, you will be less likely to think about cigarettes and consider smoking one once you've quit. \n5. Talk to your doctor about getting help to quit. There is no need to meet this challenge alone. Your doctor can help you come up with a plan to deal with withdrawal symptoms and may be able to recommend over-the-counter products such as nicotine patches, lozenges, and gum. Speaking to a medical professional will help you answer any questions you have and put you in a positive mindset for success. \n\nI hope that these suggestions help you as you create your plan to quit smoking cigarettes.

I need tips and suggestions on how to write a resume that will get noticed by hiring managers.", "role": "user"}, {"content": "Here are some useful tips that will help you improve your resume so it will be noticed by hiring managers. \n\n1. Plan Ahead - When rewriting or updating your resume, you need to focus on the key sections, which are your experience, objections, special skills, and education. The more organized you are when preparing to write your resume, the more it will show in the outcome. Get started by writing an outline so that you will know what you are going to include and what you will leave out. \n\n2. Use Action Words and Bullet Points - Action verbs are incisive and can showcase to the reader what your skills are. Use words such as managed, planned, presented, supervised, coordinated, increased, or engaged to show off your accomplishments. And be sure to use plenty of bullet points to help make your content easy to scan and read. Doing so will also make it easier for you to make clear and concise statements. \n\n3. Always Be Specific - When writing about all you have accomplished, be sure to make your statements clear and specific. Something like \"Grew department revenue by 30 percent each year\" will have more power than a statement that simply says \"increased department revenue for the company\". Be sure to use specific numbers, percentages, or dollar amounts whenever possible. It will help you get your point across. \n\n4. Focus on the Positive - Always make sure you accentuate the positive thing and leave out anything negative when writing your resume. Share any special or unique accomplishments you have made, as well as any unique skills, awards, or winning work. And while it is a good idea to place your contact details at the top of the resume, you shouldn't add any personal details beyond that. \n\n5. Make Use of Key Words - Keywords are excellent tools to use when you want to get your resume noticed. Some companies will use scanners to seek out words that are relevant to the jobs they posted. Additionally, the keywords you use can show that you have the right amount of industry knowledge for the job you are applying for. For instance, a market research professional may mention having experience in the voice of customer work, developing actionable customer insights, or analyzing high-level data and research. \n\nBy following these useful tips, you will be able to improve your resume and gain the attention of the hiring managers you want to impress.

Diffuse lavender essential oils, which provide calmness and relaxation, geranium oil can reduce stress and anxiety while elevating our mood, or peppermint oil to boost energy levels while providing a refreshing scent. \n2. Creativity: If you want a hands-on approach, try your hands at a creative outlet that satisfies your sense of touch. Adult coloring books, painting, knitting, or drawing are a few ways to relax our minds by giving our bodies something productive to do with our hands.\n3. Deep Breathing: All it takes is breathing several relaxing breaths to calm down your heart rate and calm your nervous system. Take long, concentrated breaths in through your nose, hold for a couple of seconds, and then quickly breathe out through your mouth. Do this for 1-2 min, and you will feel composed in no time.\n4.

Warrior - Warriors are possibly the most used class in RPGs. It is often known as the default choice and the warrior is typically known for their strength and ability to wield a sword. The warrior normally dons armor made out of some form of metal and also wields a sword and sometimes a shield. They have a muscular build compared to other members of the party and sometimes their opponents. They are not the most clever but can certainly get the job done, most of the time with brute force. \n\nEdelgard from Fire Emblem Three Houses is a more recent example of the Warrior class.\n\n2. Mage - Mages are probably the 2nd most common class. They typically wield a stave, staff, or some wand-type object but can also sometimes wield different weapons such as a hammer or knives. Their armor is typically a cloak and their defense is oftentimes weaker than other characters. Their magic is often consumable and can run out so they will either need to rest at an inn or use an ether to restore their MP. Black mages typically use offensive magic against their opponents such as fire or lightning while white mages use healing magic like Cure and can also heal status ailments such as poison.\n\nVivi in Final Fantasy IX is one of the most iconic characters in the RPG genre.\n\n3. Thief - Thieves are most well-known for their speed as well as their ability to steal. This is typically a command that they will have from the moment they join your party. They are normally a more slender build and typically wield knives. They wear cloaks, sometimes with hoods and often prefer to hide and may also want to hide their identity. They are known much more for their support abilities than being able to attack like a Warrior, for instance. In certain games, thieves can steal very rare pieces of equipment from bosses or difficult enemies.

Make Use of Employee Referrals - One of the most highly effective hiring strategies for today's growing companies is using employment referrals. This is a process that uses a person's professional network to find the best possible talent. Think about improving your employee referral program by switching to a stipend system for successful hires. When you choose to create a culture of respect toward these referrals, you can give your own networking connections a boost as well. \n\n2. Create a Positive Experience for Candidates - The way your prospective new talent feels about the hiring process will be based on the interactions they have with your hiring manager and anyone else they talk to at your company. Their experience may also include other interactions that take place without another person involved such as the online job application process or automated responses to their application submission. \n\n3. Consider Your Internal Recruits - Sometimes recruiting new talent internally for different positions can be more rewarding than hiring new employees. Hiring internally will reduce the amount of time it takes to hire, onboard, or train a new worker. It also cuts down on additional costs for advertising on job boards or paying for background checks. Plus, when you hire someone internally, you are typically dealing with a smaller amount of candidates, which will save you time during the screening and interviewing process. \n\n4. Make Diversity Your Priority - Having a team with diverse ideas, experiences, and backgrounds can increase your company's effectiveness and drive more innovation for your brand. Ensuring diversity is prioritized during the hiring process is a great way to guarantee a broad representation of staffing, which will help you work toward the best possible outcomes for workplace equity. \n\n5. Use a Rubric - One cornerstone of the hiring process is clear expectations. Using an interview rubric, or a checklist to analyze candidates may communicate transparency within your hiring process and make sure that the most qualified candidates will apply for the job. An interview rubric is a scoring tool that defines expectations and assists in determining who to interview, who you should call to interview again, and who to offer the new job to. This form of the rubric can be used to objectively measure both tangible and intangible details like relevant experience and demeanor. ", "role": "assistant"}], "category": "Brainstorm"}

", "prompt_id": "8c7bbdf1e40aa1ff37e0c7c65702ddf646eef895a22d58f458dbdd9ccd2cccb0", "messages": [{"content": "What are 6 things to consider when building a personal budget? Please list them out, and provide a detailed explanation of each. ", "role": "user"}, {"content": "Sure thing! To create your personal budget, follow these six steps. \n\n1. Calculate your net income. \nStart by creating your net income. Net income is the money you earn after all taxes and fees have been accounted for; it is the money that figuratively ends up in your pocket at the end of each month. This is important as the foundation of your budget. It determines how much you have available to allocate to your expense categories. A common mistake people make when calculating income is to use the gross total before taxes and pension contributions. This means they anticipate more income than they actually receive and thus leads to an inaccurate budget. To find your net income, you can look closely at some historic payslips or use one of the many online calculators. \n\n2. Track your spending.\nThe next step is to track and categorize your spending habits for 1-3 months. I would advise three months to ensure any quarterly payments are included; however, one month is enough to get a sense of spending habits in most areas. This is important as it will give you an idea of where your money goes each month and give you a solid base to create a monthly budget. To do this, you can write down each transaction you make throughout a period and assign it a category. Use an Excel spreadsheet to make things easier for you. Most banks will allow you to download a CSV file that includes all your transactions for a pre-determined period. Once downloaded, you can write a category next to each transaction. \n\n3. Set attainable goals.\nThe next thing you need to account for is the goals you have. Ensure that your goals are attainable and set a period for them also. Common goals are to pay down debt you have previously accrued or establish savings such as a three-month emergency fund. These goals should primarily be short-term and achievable within 1 to 3 years. It is ok to establish longer-term goals, but for your monthly budget, the short-term is what we are most interested in. Make sure these are motivating goals, as these will help to keep you on track when you want to disregard your budget. \n\n4. Make your plan. \nThis is where you start to formulate a budget. You have your recorded transactions and your income. Look at your recorded expenses and determine for each category what a good budget would be for each month. For some of your fixed costs, this will be obvious. Your rent, for example, will not vary month on month. Your variable costs, such as eating out, may vary monthly, so set a middle ground you are comfortable with. You will need to make separate categories that consider your goals, for instance, a vacation category where you aim to save $100 monthly. All your budgeted expenses totaled should fall within your net income number. If it doesn't, you will have to cut back somewhere. \n\n5. Stick to your budget. \nTake great care to stick within your budget. Your budget guarantees reaching those goals and living within your means. Continue to track your spending to ensure you are remaining within budget. If you see certain categories are almost fully spent and it is only the 9th of the month, this should help you to stop spending in that category. If you overspend in one category, consider reducing spending in another to stay on track. Use your goals as motivation to stick with it.\n\n6. Review regularly. \nA budget is only as good as when you do it, so maintain and update it as necessary. A pay raise at work will mean your budget can be adjusted to show more income and more capacity to save or spend. It's always good to review your budget at least quarterly, but the best budgets are updated monthly to account for the variables of life, such as birthdays, events, and other one-off occasions. It's unlikely that your December (Christmas) budget is the same as your budget for February. Use a forward-thinking approach to maintain and update your budget. There is no harm in reducing your budget in one month, so you can increase it in another so long as combined, they are within your income. ", "role": "assistant"}], "category": "Brainstorm"}

Many places in Arizona have interesting modern art, especially in the Phoenix and Scottsdale areas.  Here are some ideas for you to visit in May: \n\n1. The Phoenix Art Museum, which is not far from Scottsdale, has over 17,000 modern and contemporary works of art. The plus is, if you go with someone who likes other types of art as well, there will be something for everyone. \n2. The Eye Lounge might be perfect for you if you like eclectic places where budding contemporary artists can show off their talent. Featuring many new artists, this is a space that exhibits conceptually stimulating artworks, which inspire discussion and introspection. \n3. If you also like photography, a good option for visiting could be MonOrchid.  It's a split gallery exhibit space, which has the Bokeh Gallery and the Shade Gallery.  The Bokeh Gallery is mainly photographic artwork and digital collages. The Shade Gallery, however, is a significant space containing static and modular walls that can adapt to a variety of exhibitions. This is an ever-changing art space and is well-known by modern art enthusiasts. \n4. Perhaps you should try going to Perihelion Arts, which is a cutting-edge contemporary art gallery/artist collective that was established by Amy Young. The gallery aims to reveal the very best of contemporary art to promote public interest in the arts, with a priority on art that pushes boundaries. This includes folk, surrealism, pop surrealism, outsider, and erotic art.\n5. Another option is Oblique Art, a contemporary urban arts space and pop-up gallery located in downtown Phoenix. Obliq Art was established in 2012 intending to showcase exceptional contemporary paintings, photography and mixed media created by local Arizona artists.\n\nThese options are some of the most popular options for modern art, but there is more where that came from.  Depending on how long you'll be staying in Scottsdale, you may want to visit even more exhibits. ", "role": "assistant"}], "category": "Brainstorm"}

You will need to have different boxes and decide in advance what you will put in each box. You can sort them by year, event, or anything else you want. This will help you decide if you want to keep a dozen pictures of the same event or if you only want to keep the best ones.\n- Get Others Involved - By getting your family involved, you are lessening the workload on any one person. This may also make it fun as you all reminisce.\n- Hire Someone Else - There are companies out there who you can hire to do this for you. You pay for a box, and they scan all the pictures that will fit in the box for a certain fee and then provide you with a digital copy of them.\n\nI hope that these can help you transfer all your pictures easier!", "role": "assistant"}], "category": "Brainstorm"}

", "role": "user"}, {"content": "It's great that your son is hard-working and responsible. Here are some money-generating ideas that might help him:\n\n\u2022 Yard work: Many people have trouble taking excellent care of their yards throughout the season. The summer heat makes it difficult to maintain a yard's appearance, especially for the elderly. In spring, gardens will need to be tilled and flowers should be planted before the heat arrives. In summer, the grass grows quickly and most yards will need to be mowed at least once a week. Weeds grow continuously and will need to be trimmed or pulled.\n\n\u2022 Animal care: It's common for busy day-shifters to hire dog walkers to care for their dogs during the day and give them exercise and attention. It's also possible to wash, bathe, and groom dogs outside in the summer months without the need for special equipment. If your son has experience with reptiles, birds, rabbits, or other household pets, those opportunities might be better. When families go on summer vacation, they often need someone to look after their pets and homes.\n\n\u2022 Home upkeep: Cleaning houses is a year-round opportunity to generate income. The summer months, in particular, are good for repainting items, power washing, and upkeep on exteriors. Fences may need patching and new rocks spread in driveways.\n\n\u2022 Tutoring: Many parents worry that their children will forget what they've learned during the school year. In the absence of a formal summer school, weekly tutoring can help get children back on track and ready for the next grade level. If your son excels in academics, he can ask for recommendations from his teachers to help others before the school year ends.\n\n\u2022 Selling items: If your child has accumulated clothes and toys that they've outgrown or no longer need, a yard sale may be a way to generate income. If someone else in your neighborhood is having a yard sale, they could also contribute baked goods or lemonade for sale to generate a profit. This could be a beneficial lesson in economics too.\n\nI hope one of these works for your son!", "role": "assistant"}], "category": "Brainstorm"}

Laulau is a staple of Hawaiian cuisine that is usually served with side dishes such as white rice, macaroni salad, and lomi salmon (diced tomato, salmon, and onions).\n\n2. Kalua pork - Kalua pork is another delicious entree that consists of pork that has been seasoned and smoked. A whole pig is placed over a spit and cooked over Kiawe (mesquite) wood until the meat is tender and falls off the bone. Like laulau, kalua pork is served with side dishes as part of a complete meal.\n\n3. Shaved ice - Also known as ice shave in certain parts of Hawaii, shaved ice is a snowcone that is served in a paper cone cup and flavored with different syrups. Most places in Hawaii that serve shaved ice have numerous flavors such as vanilla, cherry, lemon, strawberry, and even cola. If you're feeling adventurous, try rainbow shaved ice (all the flavors mixed into one snowcone) or shaved ice with ice cream at the bottom of the cone!\n\n4. Spicy garlic shrimp - Many food trucks around Hawaii serve spicy garlic shrimp plates. Spicy garlic shrimp is made with shrimp that is cooked with garlic, Sriracha sauce, and butter and served on a bed of white or brown rice and a leafy green or macaroni salad. Typically served in styrofoam or cardboard food plates, spicy garlic shrimp plates are well portioned and guaranteed to fill you up.\n\n5. Poi - While this particular dish might be polarizing (you will either love it or hate it) it is definitely a Native Hawaiian dish that those who love swear by. Poi is a lavender-colored paste that is made from the corm (root) of the taro plant which is steamed until soft and mashed into a paste. The paste is then mixed with milk and sugar until it has a yogurt-like consistency and served either immediately or a day or two later when it has fermented (some people swear by this!)", "role": "assistant"}], "category": "Brainstorm"}

Dogs are almost always willing to have attention, and they love being played with. \n2. Trainability: While cats can be trained with enough patience, dogs are said to be more eager. There are many tricks that you can teach a dog. \n3. Variety: While there are varieties of cats to choose from, they are all pretty similar in size. There is much more variety when it comes to the size and temperament of the dog you can get. \n4. More Laughter: There have been studies done showing that dogs can make you laugh more than cats do. This might be because of their amusing head-tilting behavior or something else. Either way, laughter is good for you. \n5. More Accepting: People commonly dress up dogs, which happens less often with cats. \n6. Socialization: There are many places you can take your dog to, such as training classes, competitions, or even just dog parks. Each of these provides you a chance to get to make new friends with other dog owners.\n7. Encourage Responsibility: Dogs require much more responsibility than cats, as they need to go outside, be exercised, bathed, etc. Though this does mean there is more work for them, it also means they are better at teaching responsibility. \n8. Encourage Exercising: As part of the added responsibility of having a dog, you will also get daily exercise by taking them for a walk or even just taking them outside so they can use the restroom. \n9. Protection: Dogs will bark when someone is coming and can alert you of danger. \n10. Loyalty: Dogs are said to be much more loyal than cats. \n\nThese are just a few potential arguments in favor of dogs. I hope this helps!", "role": "assistant"}], "category": "Brainstorm"}

Here are some ideas for eco-friendly, sustainable packaging material: \n\n1. Edible Packaging:  Develop packaging material made from edible substances, such as seaweed, starch, or fruit peels. This would eliminate waste and provide an eco-friendly alternative to traditional packaging. This idea aligns to reduce waste and offers an innovative solution where packaging can be consumed along with the product, minimizing the effects on the environment.\n\n2. Biodegradable Packaging: Create packaging materials that can easily decompose in natural environments, reducing environmental impact and waste accumulation.  Biodegradable materials break down naturally, reducing waste accumulation in landfills and oceans, while promoting a circular economy. \n\n3. Plant-based Plastics: Explore the use of bioplastics derived from renewable resources like corn, sugarcane, or algae. These materials have a lower carbon footprint and can be recycled or composted. Using renewable resources for plastic production decreases reliance on fossil fuels and reduces greenhouse gas emissions. \n\n4. Mushroom Packaging: Investigate the use of mycelium, the vegetative part of mushrooms, as a sustainable packaging material. It is biodegradable, requires fewer resources to produce, and can be molded into various shapes. Mushroom packaging is a biodegradable and sustainable alternative to traditional packaging materials, utilizing agricultural waste as a resource.\n\n5. Minimalist Packaging: Design packaging that minimizes the use of materials and focuses on the essential aspects of product protection. This approach reduces waste and promotes a more sustainable supply chain. By focusing on essential packaging elements, waste is minimized. \n\n6. Reusable Packaging: Develop a system that encourages consumers to return packaging for reuse, similar to how glass milk bottles were collected and refilled in the past. This approach reduces waste and engages consumers in the sustainability process. This option promotes a circular economy and reduces the overall demand for new packaging materials.\n\n7. Smart Packaging: Explore the integration of sensors or indicators on the packaging that can monitor food freshness, temperature, or quality. This would help reduce waste by providing accurate information to consumers. Providing real-time information about quality and freshness helps prevent food waste by enabling informed decisions.  \n\n8. Upcycled Packaging: Investigate the use of upcycled materials, such as recycled paper or discarded textiles, to create unique and eco-friendly packaging solutions. Using discarded materials for packaging reduces waste and repurposes resources that would otherwise be sent to landfills.", "role": "assistant"}], "category": "Brainstorm"}

By developing a relationship with a single doctor who can access all of your health records, you are gaining access to someone who can help ease any sense of paranoia you may be experiencing. Not only can they give you answers to possible problems you're having, but they are trained to help you through all sorts of concerns you have regarding your health and they will be able to refer you to a therapist if necessary. It's helpful to disclose that you are experiencing health anxiety so they can work with you on record keeping, tracking the actual state of your health, and avoiding costly and unnecessary screening tests.\n2) Live a healthier lifestyle. If you are worried about your physical health, it may help to improve your lifestyle. When your body feels good, your mind does too. Try exercising, eating healthier, and drinking more water. There's also more that goes into a healthier lifestyle, like interaction. Stay active in your community, make new friends, try new hobbies, and go out of your comfort zone.\n3) Regularly attend check-ups. Don't miss any check-ups, whether it be for a doctor, dentist, or another specialist. While you're at these check-ups, ask any questions you have about your health and share your concerns with them. They can help you feel better about any medical anxiety you have.\n4) Meditate. Meditation is a way to feel your body and appreciate it, even when it doesn't feel perfectly comfortable. By meditating, you are practicing looking deeper within and experiencing what your body is feeling. You'll have a better understanding of your body and what's going on with it through meditation. Meditation is also relaxing and can help ease your feelings of anxiety. Along with that, meditation can help you to understand the signals your body is sending so that you can practice regular and effective self-care rather than rushing to a doctor's office to address every passing ache and pain.", "role": "assistant"}], "category": "Brainstorm"}

Budgeting - this is extremely helpful in gaining an idea of your income and where you're money is going. It will also help you lay out any short or long-term goals you would have regarding your finances. A good rule to follow when it comes the budgeting is known as the 50/30/20 rule. What this means is you should allocate 50% of your after-tax income to expenses you consider essential, then you would want to allocate 30% to the things you want such as amenities in the last 20% should go towards your savings. \n2. Financial safety net - this practice will allow you to have money set aside for emergencies. Doing this will allow you to not rely on using a credit card for paying for major unexpected expenses. It's common practice to save about three to six months of your current living expenses to build that emergency fund.\n3. Paying existing debts - existing debt can be a major contributing factor to the drain on your finances especially when faced with high interest rates. It's a good idea to make a plan to know how long realistically it would take you to pay off any loans or debt you may have. Cards that have the highest interest rates are the ones you're going to want to prioritize making extra payments on. You'll want to make sure you're only charging what you're capable of paying each month. ", "role": "assistant"}], "category": "Brainstorm"}

Brassicas: Cabbage, bok choy, cauliflower, and broccoli are all great options for winter gardening. Not only do they like cooler temperatures, but they tend to bolt in warm weather so it's better to plant them in autumn.\n\n2. Leafy Greens: Spinach, kale, lettuce, and Swiss chard are very hardy vegetables that thrive in cold weather. Plant seeds in early autumn or get seedlings later and you will have fresh vegetables in your garden for most of the winter months.\n\n3. Root Vegetables: Radishes, carrots, beetroot, and turnips are all vegetables harvested for their roots, which are very well protected underground. Unless your region gets a lot of snow, these vegetables are a great choice for winter gardening.\n\n4. Peas: Snow peas are a wonderful variety that can be grown outside in most weather conditions. Just make sure to sow them in early autumn so they can grow to establish healthy roots before the frosts start.\n\n5. Garlic is one of those vegetables that can't be grown at any time of year--winter is the only chance you get. Plant the cloves in autumn and watch them grow throughout the winter months.\n\nIf you have a greenhouse or solarium, you have even more options with vegetables like tomatoes and peppers thriving well into the winter months.

FYI, I live in a condo community, within a suburban metropolitan region.", "role": "user"}, {"content": "Trash littered within a community is unpleasant and can be hard to prevent if the culprits are unknown. Here are some ways to prevent trash from being littered in your community.\n\n1) Engage the HOA\nHOA groups often create and enforce policies for the residential communities they manage. Most likely, you are not the only resident observing the trash being littered around your neighborhood and there is a high chance that other neighbors share the discontent. If your townhouse community has an HOA, bringing this issue to their attention at the next HOA meeting may be a good way to start. With enough support from other residents and approval from the HOA board, guidelines can be set restricting any trash to be littered. HOA often also have the power, written into the contractual agreements signed by residents before move-in, to enforce rules they set. Penalties for residents refusing to comply with rules may range from thousands of dollars in fees to eviction. If new HOA rules making improper disposal of trash can be set, then residents will have to eventually comply, assuming the root cause is from within the community. HOAs may even help lead preventative strategies attempting to proactively address the problem. Some strategies include the installation of waste baskets for general use, increasing the frequency of waste management services, installing street signs, and/or employing third-party street cleaning services. \n\n2) Establish a Neighborhood Watch Group\nA neighborhood watch, also called a crime watch is an organized group of civilians devoted to crime and vandalism prevention within a neighborhood, including littering. Similar to HOA organizations, members of watch groups are often intrinsically motivated to maintain a clean neighborhood and share the same common goals. Neighborhood watch groups can be as informal or formal as one would like, although informal methods may be easier to start if your community does not have such a group in place already. Typically, informal watch groups involve select community residents patrolling and monitoring the community looking out for any suspicious activity, crime, or other behavior breaking rules. A schedule is usually shared between volunteers listing out availabilities, procedures in case of emergencies, and contact information, including local law enforcement. Having an active neighborhood watch group monitoring the community will likely deter the culprits. Although the initial purpose of starting a watch group may be to catch and deter litterers, it is possible that the group also inadvertently encounters more serious and dangerous criminals who have gone unnoticed in the past. Depending on the danger of the threats, and if the watch group volunteers are inexperienced or untrained in handling more threatening situations, then risks can quickly escalate beyond what was anticipated. Therefore, the safety of the volunteers within the group is an important concern and should remain a high priority. \n\n3) Contact local law enforcement\nLaw enforcement will likely be able to assist in preventing trash to be littered in your community. Law enforcement is a public service and it can be argued that trash is impeding the well-being of the local public. A big advantage of involving law enforcement over creating a local neighborhood watch group is that the former has extensive experience and training in dealing with a wide range of threats, while the latter may not. For example, if the litterers also coincidentally happen to be wanted fugitives then law enforcement would be prepared to apprehend the criminals safely away from the community residents. Another advantage of involving law enforcement to eliminate trash being littered in your community is that they can adjust their levels of engagement depending on the severity of the issues. If the trash being littered is largely immaterial or non-threatening, then they may elect to install street signs warning culprits of the consequences of littering or occasionally patrol the street in marked police cars. Law enforcement may even leave a marked police car in plain sight within the community since the sight of a police car is known to reduce the chances of criminal activity in most cases. However, if trash being littered is significantly harming the residents (e.g., hazardous materials, food waste, heavy items, etc.), then law enforcement will likely elect to increase their engagement and may even dedicate an officer present at all times. As illustrated, some of the benefits of contacting law enforcement are the flexibility of engagement, the depth of their expertise, and nearly unlimited resources in combatting the littering issue.", "role": "assistant"}], "category": "Brainstorm"}

Know the types of keywords - There are four main types of keywords, some being simple words, and some being entire phrases. When you know about the different kinds of keywords, you can make them a part of your SEO content strategy. One type of keyword is buyer intent keywords, which are used in the buying process's last stage. There are also short-tail and long-tail keywords. Short-tail keywords are less than three words, and long-tail keywords are longer and have less search volume. There are also question keywords, which are questions.\n3. Know search intent - Why are people searching this content? When you know this, you can use the intent of searches to craft content around. You can also use search intent to improve blog titles. Try to find search intent keywords that bring you targeted traffic and use these keywords in your meta description as well as the title. The types of search intent are \"informational\", which is when someone looks for information, \"navigational \"when someone is looking for a specific site, \"transactional\" when a person is looking to purchase something, and \"commercial\" when someone is looking for the perfect product for them.\n4.

Refine marketing strategy. \nFirst, you must set clear goals and expectations, define your target audience, research the competition, and focus on what makes you stand out. By doing this, you give yourself clear metrics to be measured by. A goal allows you to track progress and identify when more work may be needed. Knowing your target audience makes it easier to produce content. Researching your competition can both inspire you and better you. Focusing on what stands out from the crowd will enable you to create engaging content. \n\n2. Create valuable content. \nIf your content doesn't give your readers any value, the likelihood of them engaging with you or continuing to follow you is slim. Your audience sees a whole load of content daily that is useless for them or simply too like other content. Create valuable content to stand out and grow a following that knows you constantly have them in mind. This will help to solidify your audience.\n\n3. Engage with your followers. \nTweets providing value are great, but the one thing we value most is human connection. Engage and connect with followers through DM or in replies. This will help foster a genuine connection with your audience and show them that you care and are responsive to them. This is extremely important, considering how many people are online. If you create that bond with people, they can be more forgiving when you make mistakes and more supportive when needed. \n\n4. Use trending hashtags.\nHashtags are an incredible way to grow the visibility of your tweets. Try to see what is currently trending and produce content that hops on that bandwagon. The more people that see your tweets, the better, and using a trending hashtag vastly improves the chances prospective new followers will see your tweets. Be careful not to use too many hashtags, as this can be seen as spam.\n\n5. Reuse and Repurpose.\nComing up with new content all the time can be pretty tough. There is no harm in reusing or repurposing old content. In many cases, the point will remain valuable if it's valuable content. Simply saying the same thing differently or highlighting a new use case for information is an excellent way to churn out lots of content over time. Obviously, it's not good to copy and paste your old tweets. Try improving them with better wording so your content constantly improves. ", "role": "assistant"}], "category": "Brainstorm"}

Can you give me some insight into how to become more approachable?", "role": "user"}, {"content": "I can help you with that. Here are some simple ways to allow yourself to become more approachable.\n\n1. Smile - a simple, friendly facial expression comes off as inviting to people. You want to make sure the smile seems natural and warm when you are at the office or at a work event. Upon making eye contact with someone, it's good to acknowledge them by smiling a bit bigger.\n2. Eye contact - you want to make sure to maintain eye contact when you greet someone and while having conversations. For example, if you are at an event or conference, you want to make eye contact and smile at any strangers that look in your direction. If you get the feeling that you are staring when making eye contact, you can blink occasionally or simply focus on the area in between the person's eyes.\n3. Angle towards people - it's good practice when talking to someone to angle your body towards them to show that you are interested in the conversation. You want to focus on turning your feet and legs towards that person and allow your body to follow. This is good to do either sitting or standing. However, if you are sitting, you might also want to lean in slightly as it will show that you are listening and engaged in the conversation.\n4. Look up - it's good to keep your head and eyes up when you're walking around the office or at events. This is because when you are looking up and ahead it is easier to make eye contact with others and greet them. It's important to note that people read your face to determine your approachability. Staring at the floor or your feet will cause the person to not be able to assess your interest.\n5. Avoid fidgeting - having nervous habits can give the impression that you are anxious. You want to avoid fidgeting with things like your keys, pen, or hair or simply doing something you might not be aware of, such as cracking your knuckles or touching your face. You'll want to focus on keeping your hands at your sides or in your lap or just using them to gesture rather than fidgeting during conversations.", "role": "assistant"}], "category": "Brainstorm"}

Suspicious charges can be frustrating. Here are some recommendations for how to best protect your funds:\n\n1) Stick to large, reputable banks and institutions. Although there is some data that suggests large banks are more likely to be targets of cyberattacks, they are also more prepared to handle them. Small, hometown banks often have less rigorous security standards and a smaller amount of available cash flow, meaning that they cannot immediately refund your funds and must wait until the dispute has settled.\n\n2) Complete all purchases on a credit card, rather than a debit card. Although this seems counter-intuitive, as credit cards incur interest, they are also much safer. When disputing a credit card charge, you do not have to pay the funds until the dispute is settled. It's much easier to stop a charge than it is to recover funds once they have departed your account. Furthermore, interest is only paid on credit card charges that carry over to the next month or interest period, and some might even offer perks like cash back on purchases or point accrual towards future discounts or interest rates.\n\n3) Use a verified transaction company, such as Paypal, when completing online purchases. Paypal has buyer protection and can handle disputes efficiently. Smaller sites with their own payment processors might not be as safe and verified as they assert themselves to be, nor will they be as conveniently reachable in the event of a dispute. \n\n4) Refrain from linking your bank account, debit card, or credit card to any services. Saving your information in their system creates a database that can be breached at any point in the future if your password is discovered or the company suffers a cyberattack. Typing your information each time makes this less likely, although not impossible. \n\n5) Change your passwords frequently and don't save them on websites or in your browser. Using strong passwords and changing them frequently significantly reduces the likelihood they will be involved in a company's data breach. You may not be immediately notified of a compromised password, so don't reuse them.\n\n6) Diversify your accounts. As the saying goes, \"don't keep all of your eggs in one basket.\" Your checking account should be used for flowing cash, while your savings account should hold any lump sums that you may need access to in emergencies. Beyond your emergency fund, you can store cash in certificates of deposits (CDs) or investments that earn interest.\n\n7) Stay aware of your account and purchases. Turn on purchase alerts if your bank offers them. Balance your checkbook and review your account frequently to notice any strange charges. The earlier these charges are caught, the easier they are resolved.\n\nI hope these suggestions help better protect your funds in the future!", "role": "assistant"}], "category": "Brainstorm"}

Keep the ends sticking up like bunny ears.\n\n6.

Bring some fun multiplayer board games, and a deck of cards in case anyone wants to play solitaire.\n-Arts and crafts: This will be a great time to experiment with arts and crafts such as watercolor painting, wood carving, knitting, embroidery, sculpting, wood burning/etching, and more. Your kids could also try their hands at some extra messy projects like tie-dye, making goo from scratch, paper mache, or splatter painting a la Jackson Pollock since you won't have to worry about making a mess inside your home. \n-Puzzles: Bring a book of crosswords or sudoku puzzles, and maybe a jigsaw puzzle that the whole family can work on together.\n-Play music: Camping provides a great opportunity to practice playing acoustic instruments such as the guitar, ukulele, hand drums, flute, or fiddle.\n-Sports: Bring a soccer ball, basketball, football, or tennis ball and racket so the kids can play together and exhaust themselves with some exercise.\n-Hiking: Trail hiking makes a fun family excursion.\n-Boating: There are several bodies of water in the Sierra Mountains. If you own a boat, you can bring it with you, or you may be able to rent one just for the trip. You could canoe, kayak, or use a motorized boat. Have the kids bring bathing suits, too, in case the water's warm enough for a swim. \n-Biking: Like hiking, this is a great way to explore the area, but you\u2019ll be able to cover a lot more ground in a shorter amount of time on wheels than you could on foot.\n-Star gazing: Bring a book of star maps and/or a telescope and spend the evenings searching for constellations and shooting stars.\n-Campfire rituals: Replace the habit of zoning out in front of the tv after dinner with a nightly campfire ritual. You can cook dinner over the fire, make s\u2019mores together, and take turns telling ghost stories, or opt for family stories if your kids don\u2019t enjoy being scared.", "role": "assistant"}], "category": "Brainstorm"}

Here are some ways people choose names for new things:\n- The Creator's Name - Many people include their own last or first name in a flower they create or discover. This ensures that they are remembered as being the person who created it. This can be their unaltered name, a nickname, or an alteration of their name that seems to fit the plant more for whatever reason. \n- Someone's Name - Along with being named after the creator, it is also fairly common to name a plant after a loved one, a movie star, a mentor, etc. \n- It's Appearance - Most flowers are named after something that has to do with their appearance, whether this is the shape of their leaves, the color of their flowers, or something else unique about the plant. For example, a flower variation that is blue might be named Sky Blue, Ocean View, or something else that brings to mind the color. \n- Something Important - Some people who name things choose a name that has meaning for them. For example, if you have another hobby besides your flowers that you enjoy, you could include that hobby in the name. Also, if you have been through a tough time, you can make the name hopeful or include any word that has meaning to you.\nHopefully, this helps you come up with name ideas for your new flower!", "role": "assistant"}], "category": "Brainstorm"}

Here are some tips that can help you get started with taking care of your cat.\n\n1. Groom regularly - while cats groom themselves and are known for being clean, it is good to give them some extra help as it can help with their overall health and hygiene. No matter the hair length of the cat, they all can benefit from it. Having a routine for grooming the cat will help prevent shedding and hairballs.\n2. Always provide fresh water - this is essential to the cat's health. Ensuring they have fresh water all the time will help prevent health issues common in cats, such as kidney disease and urinary tract infections. One thing to keep note of is that cats can be picky about the water they drink. If you notice this, then it may be beneficial to invest in the water fountain, as some cats prefer moving water.\n3. Proper place to potty - it may be beneficial to have more than one litter box in some situations, especially if you have more than one cat. This allows your cat to have options if they don't feel like using one letterbox for a particular reason. You also want to ensure that the litter box's placed in an area that is easily accessible for the cat and comfortable.\n4. Consistently clean the litter box - continuing on the topic of litter boxes, it's very important to always make sure that the litter box is maintained and clean. If it gets to the point where it's too full or dirty for the cat, they may find other areas to relieve themselves, such as the carpet or different items such as pillows or clothing. It's good practice to clean out the litter box daily and do a full cleaning of the box at least weekly.\n5. Scratching-post training - it is common, natural, and even considered healthy behavior for cats to scratch. The downside of this is that they may use our home decor as a means to satisfy the urge to scratch. The main reason the cat needs to scratch as it is a means for them to remove old layers from their claws. It may take some time to get them used to a scratching post, but it's well worth the time and effort.", "role": "assistant"}], "category": "Brainstorm"}

The process is to trap the unsterilized cats, get them spayed or neutered, and then return them to their original outside neighborhood.

Bait the trap for several days at a typical feeding time for the cat, draping a towel or sheet over it. After the cat is used to going in and eating, set the trap. Use especially pungent food for bait like warm chicken or fish. When the cat gets to the back of the trap for food, stepping on the \"trip plate\" sets off the trap. Be sure to check the trap every hour if possible, and make sure the trap isn't exposed to the elements like direct sun or rain.\n\nDrop trap - Some cats become trap savvy after being exposed to the humane trap. Another option is a drop-trap, where a box is propped up on a stick with a rope attached. Food is placed at the far edge of the box. When the cat comes to eat, the rope is pulled, yanking away the stick and dropping the trap. Cover the box with a sheet or towel. The door of the box is centered with the door of the humane trap, and the cat will quickly move to the humane trap, believing it is an exit.

Listen Up: Practice active listening by focusing on the nuances of communication - tone, intonation, pace, and body language. It\u2019s a particularly essential skill if you plan to interact with French speakers in a professional setting, as it can help you read social cues and respond appropriately. Incorporate this practice into your everyday life, from conversations to conference calls to TV shows.\n\n9. Say Oui to Speaking French ASAP: While it may be tempting to start with grammar rules and vocabulary lists, the key to really improving your language skills is to start speaking as soon as possible. Find a conversation partner or sign up for a language exchange program to practice your French in a supportive environment.\n\n10. Embrace Your Inner Faux Pas: Making mistakes is a natural part of learning any new skill, and language learning is no exception. Remember that every slip-up is a learning opportunity, and don't get too hung up on getting every verb conjugation perfect.\n\n11. Parlez-Vous Fran\u00e7ais? Use the Language to Learn the Language: Learning a language isn't just about memorizing grammar rules and vocabulary lists. To truly master French, you'll need to immerse yourself in the language as much as possible.\n\n12. Make French a Part of Your Routine: Consistency is key when it comes to language learning. Set aside a specific time every day to practice your French, whether it's 30 minutes in the morning or an hour before bed. By making French a regular part of your daily routine, you'll improve your language skills without disrupting your busy schedule.", "role": "assistant"}], "category": "Brainstorm"}

Introduce yourself, get to know people, make friends and go out to eat together. Bond with people and create incredible memories with those that you cross paths with.\n\n- Be considerate: Don\u2019t touch other people's stuff and be mindful when coming home that others may be sleeping. Use a cellphone flashlight to navigate at night and avoid turning the light on. Respect the quiet hours and be sure that when it's time to sleep your actions don\u2019t prevent others from getting some shut-eye.\n\n- Bring what you need to the shower: Bring everything you need to the shower so you can do everything in there. Don\u2019t walk back to the room in your towel. Be sure to have a towel and either bring one or get one from the hostel staff. Bring sandals for the walk\n\n- Practice kitchen etiquette: Clean up after yourself in the kitchen, there are no maids and no one wants to clean up a mess that\u2019s not theirs. Don\u2019t eat other people\u2019s food unless told it\u2019s okay. Make sure you aren\u2019t leaving anything behind.\n\n- Bring earplugs and a face mask: You can\u2019t predict the nighttime habits of your roommates or whether or not they will snore. Be sure to bring earplugs and a facemask to help shut out the outside world and allow yourself to get the best possible sleep.\n\n- Have check-in info ready: For the fastest and smoothest experience have your check-in information and confirmation ready before you arrive so you can easily provide it and quickly get checked into your room.\n", "role": "assistant"}], "category": "Brainstorm"}

DollarSprout Rewards - DollarSprout Rewards can be installed on your desktop browser as an extension. It works by automatically recognizing when you are about to purchase from a participating merchant such as Walgreens, Walmart, or Old Navy, and it prompts you to claim your cashback reward. Once you accumulate $5 in earnings after any amount of time, they pay out through the user's PayPal account the following month. \n\n2. Capital One Shopping - Capital One Shopping is an online browser extension as well as an app that applies coupons every time you check out. It lets you earn credits for shopping locally and informs you when there's a better price from another retailer. Users also have the option to add items to their Capital One Shopping watchlist so they can track prices and be notified when there's a better deal out there for them. \n\n3. Dosh - This cashback shopping app rewards you with everyday shopping both online and in-store. All you have to do is link your card to the app once and then enjoy the cash-back benefits over time as you shop. The great thing about the app is that it doesn't control or pressure you into making purchases you don't need simply because something is on sale. \n\n4. Rakuten - This popular shopping app issues cash back for shopping at popular online stores and a few local stores as well. Shopping on Rakuten is easy and you can do it both on the dedicated app or on your home computer. All you have to do to get started is open the Rakuten app on your phone and search the store of your choice using the search bar. Then click on any referral link to visit the store of your choosing and go about your normal shopping activities. \n\n5. Drop - Drop is an app that is similar to Rakuten which issues cash back for purchases made through qualifying links. The main difference is that Drop will pay you back in gift cards instead of in cash. But if you like the idea of gaining credits toward gift cards to your favorite stores then this would be a great option for you. After you accumulate 5,000 points on Drop, you can redeem them for a $5 gift card of your choice. ", "role": "assistant"}], "category": "Brainstorm"}

", "role": "user"}, {"content": "Here are four tips on how to ask for a raise at work for someone who's never done that before along with an explanation of what each tip is meant to accomplish. Each tip aims to keep your raise request professional and polite, but also firm and direct:\n\n1. Find any and all positive feedback since your last performance review. Once you've made your meeting request, prepare for it by finding any and all evidence that your recent performance has surpassed expectations. In order to be both firm and direct in your meeting, you will need to be able to present concrete examples of how you've performed at an above-average level. Keep in mind, your boss may not interpret your evidence in exactly the same way as you do, so ensure that you remain calm and stick to the facts no matter what they say.\n \n2. Come prepared with data and numbers. In order to present the most persuasive and compelling case for your raise, it's best to be able to clearly point to specific numbers and data that demonstrate your value to the organization. By presenting specific metrics and tangible goals you've accomplished, you will be able to show visually that you have outperformed your current salary. Relying on data also helps keep your meeting objective, removing personal bias or emotion from the equation and allowing you and your boss to focus on the numbers. \n\n3. Explain what you\u2019ll bring to the team in the coming year. Once you've discussed your past performance, be sure to also focus on your goals for the future. Frame your raise request as an investment, something that will pay off for the organization by demonstrating a clear commitment to one of its top performers. Remember to remain calm and clear as you talk about the future in order to avoid over-selling your commitment and having it come off as insincere.\n\n4. Identify the salary range you\u2019ll ask for and know how to justify it. One of the most awkward parts of a meeting to discuss a raise is inevitably the question of how much exactly to ask for. This is definitely something you will want to think about beforehand and be prepared to justify based on the evidence you will present. It's important that when it comes time to discuss the specific parameters of your raise request, you be able to point to specific, objective reasons why your numbers are fair so that your boss can best understand and hopefully agree with your point of view. \n \nHopefully, this list assists you as you prepare to request a raise at your workplace.

Brazilian Jiujitsu - One of the best martial arts for both self-defense and a killer workout, Brazilian Jiujitsu (BJJ) provides practitioners with real-world self-defense. Many fights end up on the ground, and those who are not used to maneuvering on their backs will find themselves defenseless, trying to protect against attacks from above. In addition to the self-defense skills you'll learn in BJJ, you'll also get a tremendous workout that is sure to tax your aerobic and anaerobic systems. \n2. Muay Thai - This martial art from Thailand is such a huge sport that modern mixed martial artists have incorporated it into their training regimens. Muay Thai is a form of kickboxing that also makes use of elbow and knee strikes, as well as throws and leg sweeps. A good defensive martial art teaches you to strike with multiple different parts of your body, and Muay Thai does just that. You'll also get a great cardio workout doing several rounds of Muay Thai kickboxing against a sparring partner or potential opponent.\n3. Kung Fu/Wushu - Kung Fu and Wushu are Chinese martial arts that have been around for centuries. While Kung Fu can mean anything that requires skill (i.e., you can have good \"Kung Fu\" washing dishes or driving a car), the martial art of Kung Fu is specifically a fighting art that teaches multiple stances, punches, and kicks, the most popular of which mimic the movements of animals like the snake, the crane, and the tiger. A great workout can be had practicing stances and forms that require you to stand in unusual positions, such as a horse stance, for several minutes at a time. Wushu (the competitive version of Kung Fu) stresses the importance of performative martial art through high jumps and kicks, twirls, flips, and other choreographed moves.\n4. Judo - Much like the other grappling arts, Judo is a Japanese art that involves throwing one's opponent and also using their momentum and body weight against themselves. In addition to throws, Judo also practices grappling (both on the ground and while standing) and submissions (joint locks, strangles). Judo can be likened to lifting weights due to having to throw and carry your opponent, which can be tiring.\n5. Karate - Karate, like its Chinese counterpart in Kung Fu, is a martial art that involves the use of strikes and stances. However, Karate's development in Japan created a martial art that promotes striking opponents hard and fast; straight punches and kicks that snap from the waist are favored over the flowery techniques of Kung Fu and Wushu. As with all the other martial arts listed above, Karate offers a great workout practicing striking and forms.", "role": "assistant"}], "category": "Brainstorm"}

Long replies run the risk of being misinterpreted. Pick one major point of contention within his email and respond directly to that. \n- Organize your thoughts. Don't reply with the first thing that springs to mind. Take a moment to try and understand the root of the issue, including analyzing the situation from your boss's perspective, and ensure your thoughts make sense before you send your reply.  \n- Be polite. De-escalate the situation by sending a calm and well-mannered reply. Resist the temptation to meet anger with anger as that could make a tense situation even worse. If you remain polite, you increase the likelihood that he will eventually calm down and your conversation can become productive.\n- Don't be defensive. Your boss is responding with emotion, not reason, so don't give him more justification to be emotional by sending a response that is overly defensive. Instead, appeal to his logic and reason so that you can work together to resolve the issue rather than argue about it. \n", "role": "assistant"}], "category": "Brainstorm"}

The Salem Witch Trials in Massachusetts occurred in 1692-1693 during which there were at least 20 executions and more than 200 witch accusations. Something as simple as having a pet cat, a sour attitude, or a lucky streak could put a woman in danger of witch accusations. If executed, these women could be hung, burned, or drowned.\n\n\u2022 Names: Beyond the history of the Witch Trials, researching the time period and using common names of the era (Jonathon, Thomas, Samuel, William, Sarah, and Bridget, for example) will make the story seem more grounded.\n\nI hope these inspire the necessary details for your novel!", "role": "assistant"}], "category": "Brainstorm"}

Affordable. \nMedellin is a very affordable place to live compared to other big cities worldwide. An apartment in Medellin will cost you about $600-$700. A meal out in Medellin will likely set you back around $3-$5 for a main, soup, and juice. A trip to the cinema will cost as little as $6 per person. \n\n2. Great weather. \nThe City is called the City of eternal spring. If you like nice weather, not too cold, Medellin is perfect as it's spring-like weather all year round. The city doesn't have high humidity; however, you can expect some rain during the rainy season. It will mostly rain for short showers in the afternoon. \n\n3. Learning Spanish.\nIf you want to learn another language, then Medellin is perfect for learning Spanish.

International food options. \nThe food in Medellin is delicious, and there are many local options to try. However, if you are searching for some home-country cooking, you can rest easy knowing Medellin has a wide variety of foods from around the globe. This is in large part thanks to the ex-pat community. \n\n7. Fast and reliable WI-FI.\nIf you are moving to Medellin and plan on working online or simply streaming movies, you will wonder about the WI-FI.

However, if you're experiencing chronic poor sleep, you should contact your healthcare provider to identify and treat any underlying causes. In the meantime, try these suggestions:\n\n1. Set a sleep schedule and stick to it -- Healthy adults are recommended to get at least 7 hours of sleep a night, and most don't need more than 8 hours to be well rested. By going to bed and getting up at the same time every day (including weekends), you can make your body's sleep-wake cycle more consistent.\n2. Monitor your diet -- Going to bed either hungry or overly full can impair sleep quality, so you should try to avoid any heavy meals just before bed. You should also exercise caution with nicotine, caffeine, and alcohol consumption. Nicotine and caffeine take hours to wear off, and alcohol can disrupt sleep later in the night.\n3. Establish a restful environment -- Rooms that are cool, dark, and quiet are more conducive to restful sleep while light-emitting screens tend to be disruptive. You can use earplugs, room-darkening shades, fans, and white noise machines to help construct a suitable sleep space. Utilizing relaxation techniques or taking a bath can also help calm you and prepare you for a good night's sleep.\n4. Limit naps during the day -- Unless you're working nights and need to make up a sleep debt, you should avoid napping late in the day. If you do take a daytime nap, restrict it to no more than one hour to avoid interference with your nighttime sleep.\n5. Get regular physical activity -- While you shouldn't be too active close to bedtime when you're trying to wind down, being physically active as part of your daily routine can promote better rest. Spending time outside is a great way to do this and provides other health benefits as well.\n6. Reduce stress -- Lingering concerns won't do your sleep schedule any favors. One way to deal with these is to journal what's on your mind before bed so you can set it aside for the next day. Meditation can ease anxiety as well, and stress management techniques such as setting priorities, getting organized, and delegating tasks can keep your mental space clear and ready for sleep.\n\nAre you interested in learning more about any of these steps?", "role": "assistant"}], "category": "Brainstorm"}

Thus it would not be unreasonable to imagine that the space future equivalent would be a datapad. This would do more than simply clip documents and provide a writing surface, however. It would also be able to store and display multimedia information.\n2. Multi-spectrum goggles: These goggles would allow the adjuster to view and analyze anything from malfunctioning equipment to the scene of a spaceport accident. It would also provide a variety of vision modes, including visible light, infrared light, and ultraviolet.\n3. Sampling equipment: As part of their job, the adjuster may need to sample evidence to support their observations and investigations. A suitcase-sized sampling kit would serve well for both acquiring all manner of material evidence and storing them securely.\n4. Quantum Communicator: A space insurance adjuster would likely have to travel to remote parts of the galaxy as part of their job. A quantum communicator would enable the adjuster to keep in close contact with claimants, the space police, and the head office.\n5. Company hardhat: Falling objects remain a danger in the far future as well. In addition, the company logo helps identify the claims adjuster to those around them, helping to explain their questions and why they are there. \n6. Pocket protector: As part of the company uniform, the space insurance adjuster may have to dress professionally in office attire. A pocket protector would allow them to store their pens and other writing implements without dirtying their shirt with grease, reactor coolant, and alien goop.

The response is formatted in a bullet-point list:\n\n- Look at the person who's talking. It's hard to listen if you are answering a text message, browsing the internet, or otherwise engaged in another activity. Give the speaker your undivided attention and make an effort to look at them in order to focus your mind and your ears on what they are telling you so that you can commit their words to your long-term memory. \n- Visualize what the speaker is saying. It may help you to create mental images that connect to what the speaker is talking about. This visual association can assist you in remembering keywords and phrases from their speech so that you can ultimately retain more of what they said. \n- Keep an open mind. It's a fact of life that people will say things that you don't agree with, but it's important to keep an open mind and reserve judgment until they're finished speaking. When you make a snap judgment, you compromise your ability to listen to the entirety of what they're saying. If your goal is to become a better listener, you are best served to wait until someone is finished talking before analyzing how your views line up with theirs.\n- Don't interrupt. There's a distinct difference between listening and simply waiting to talk. If you want to become a better listener, you have to give the speaker the ability to fully communicate their thoughts at their own pace without disrupting their train of thought.  \n- Ask clarifying questions. Once the speaker is done talking, you want to make sure that you fully understand their thoughts. A great way to accomplish that is to ask them to clarify anything that didn't quite make sense to you or that you would like to understand in more depth. By asking them clarifying questions, you will help yourself both retain and understand what they've said to you.\n\nI hope that these tips help you become a better listener. Please let me know if I can be of more assistance.   ", "role": "assistant"}], "category": "Brainstorm"}

If you\u2019re planning a corporate event for over 50 people, it\u2019s best to enlist some help. A team of planners can ensure that the project stays on track to its completion. \n\n2.\tGood location.\nThe location should be central to employees but in an area with good parking. If the event will take place after dark, make sure the area has good lighting and security.\n\n3.\tDelicious food.\nChoose a menu that is versatile and will appeal to a wide range of partygoers. Chicken is a favorite at corporate events, but seafood is also popular.\n\n4.\tFun entertainment and music.\nYou might be able to hire a local band to play live music during the event. Decide on the style of music, whether country, rock, soul, etc., then search for local talent online.\n\n5.\tThe budget.\nPay close attention to your budget. Sometimes the company will allow overages for certain expenses but often the budget for corporate events is set in stone and non-negotiable. \n\nWhen hiring a professional event planner, search for an organization that has a proven track record. Most corporate event planners offer various packages that include everything from start to finish as well as streamlined services for those on a budget. \n\nPros: \n\u2022\tRemoves all the work and worry from company employees.\n\u2022\tBetter overall results.\n\nCons: \n\u2022\tExpensive. \n\u2022\tNo room for changing the theme or other details without incurring additional expenses.", "role": "assistant"}], "category": "Brainstorm"}

Makes some art - staying on the topic of mud, it could be a really good idea to make some temporary artwork. You can take a lot of mud and sculpt it into whatever you want or simply use the mud as a means to paint something. The good thing about this is that it's all temporary and will wash away, so you won't have to worry about any cleanup.\n4.

Here is a list of three lost cities that have been rediscovered.\n\n1. Ebla, Syria\nThe ancient city of Ebla, now known as Tell Mardikh, was a major city circa 3000 BCE. Ebla's ruins are located 33 miles (53 km) southwest of Aleppo in northwestern Syria. Site excavation started in 1964 and, in 1974, led to the discovery of tablets written in the Semitic vernacular. The tablets were translated and, as verified by texts from other civilizations, confirmed that the site was the lost city of Ebla. \n\n2. Troy, Turkey\nExcavation of the mound of Hisarlik, which archeologists believed was the ancient city of Troy, started in 1870. They soon discovered that Troy was rebuilt seven times with the first construction around 3000 BCE.  Over time, war, fire and earthquakes destroyed the city and a new Troy was constructed over the remains. The Troy of  Homer\u2019s Iliad, unearthed in Troy VI and VII layers, was in the Late Bronze Age. The city is located on the Hisarlik mound on the Turkish Aegean and is about five kilometers away from the Dardanelles' southern entrance.\n\n3. Mohenjo Daro, Pakistan\nIn Pakistan's Sindh Province, in Larkana District, archeologists discovered the remains of Mohenjo Dara in 1922. The thousand-year city existed from around 2500 BCE to 1700 BCE in the Indus Valley. The city was zoned into districts for residential and industrial use and boasted a citadel constructed on a 40-foot high platform. One great mystery of this civilization, however, remains.

Raccoons plant seeds - Raccoons love treats such as nuts, berries, and fruits. As raccoons travel, they expel the seeds of these plants alongside tree seeds. Because of this, they spread natural life throughout the environment.\n2. They dig - Raccoons are diggers, as they do it to search for food. Doing so promotes proper decomposition, helps with soil turnover, and benefits plant recruitment. This helps the ecosystem they live in to function and renew.\n3. They protect bees - It's fairly well known that bees are essential in the pollination and life of plants. Wasps pose a threat to bees, and raccoons eat wasp lava. This prevents wasp colonization in their environments.\n4. Raccoons promote clean and healthy ecosystems - Raccoons also promote the cleanliness and healthiness of their environments. This comes from the fact that they scavenge. This scavenging process gets rid of animal remains, or carrion. By doing so, they also clean up the ecosystem.\n5. Raccoons control parasites - Raccoons also feed on parasites that are out of control in their environment, such as rats, toads, and snakes.

Red Rock Canyon National Conservation Area \nVisitors to Las Vegas can take a trip to the Red Rock Canyon National Conservation Area and admire the colorful rock formations as they walk its many hiking trails or go on a 13-mile scenic drive. \n\n3. The Strip \nThe infamous Las Vegas strip is one attraction you will not want to miss. This strip stretches over 4.2 miles and it is known as the most famous entertainment destination in the United States. It showcases an eclectic collection of mega hotels and resorts as well as glitzy casinos, lavish shopping malls, and Michelin-starred restaurants. The ideal way to enjoy the Las Vegas Strip is to take a walk down the avenue and admire the free attractions like the dancing fountains or the erupting volcanoes at The Mirage. You can also take a break by going on one of the many bus tours that take you on a ride down the boulevard. \n\n4. Fremont Street Experience \nThis downtown Las Vegas attraction is a pedestrian mall that spreads over five blocks along Fremont Street. It is home to various casinos and hotels, including the Golden Gate Hotel and Casino as well as the Binion's Gambling Hall and Hotel. Fremont Street is also well known for its jaw-dropping shows and exciting exhibits. \n\n5. High Roller \nThe High Roller is the largest Ferris well in the world. It stands 550 feet tall and is located at the LINQ. This ride allows passengers to soar above Las Vegas for a unique panoramic view of the city. Each revolution takes about 30 minutes and each cabin can hold up to 40 people at once. The views are the best at night when the city is fully illuminated. And you can choose to buy a Happy Hour ticket that comes with an open bar in your cabin. \n\n", "role": "assistant"}], "category": "Brainstorm"}

Here are some tips on how to prepare for your upcoming trip:\n\n1. Make an itinerary - Write down exactly what you plan to do and when you plan to do it. Making an itinerary gives you an outline of the events that are to take place during your trip, as well as the amount of time you expect to spend doing each activity so you can see and do everything you want within a set time.\n2. Research - When deciding to take a cross-country trip, do your research into what activities you want to do, what sights you want to see, and where you want to go. Research what your mode(s) of transportation will be (rental car, train, bus, bike) for each step of the trip, and budget your time and money accordingly.\n3. Plan ahead - Traveling long distances requires planning to ensure the trip is enjoyable. This includes planning for situations that will arise, such as being hungry or thirsty, fatigue, and other issues. Consider bringing snacks, food, and water, or look for restaurants and rest stops along your planned route of travel. If traveling via rental car, make sure you know where the gas stations are along your route and ensure your gas tank is filled up for the long trip ahead. Bring spare articles of clothing in case the clothes you're wearing become dirty, and bring clothing that matches the environments you will be in, such as warm clothing for cold areas.\n4. Charge your phone - In case of an emergency, you will want to have a phone that is fully charged and capable of making calls for assistance. Also, having a fully charged phone will allow you to take photos that will memorialize your trip.", "role": "assistant"}], "category": "Brainstorm"}

Get a scratching post. Cats groom and shed their nails by scratching things. To stop them from scratching your furniture, get a decent-sized scratching post that is tall enough for your cat to stretch out a bit when scratching.\n\n2. Brush your cat. Cats are great at grooming themselves, but it helps to brush them regularly to prevent hairballs and extra shedding.\n\n3. Give your cat stimulating toys. Different cats have different preferences for toys, so try to find a type that your cat specifically likes. It's good to get them a variety of toys because they need the extra stimulation.\n\n4. Buy or plant some cat grass. This plant is pretty easy to grow both indoors and outdoors and will be helpful to your cat's digestion.\n\n5. Give your cat a little catnip.

In some areas, if you want to legally operate a snowmobile, you will need to carry a legitimate driver's license, a license from your home state, country, or province, or a motorized snow vehicle operator's license (also known as an MSVOL). \n\n* In many areas, you will also need to have proof of insurance as well as your snowmobile registration permit. All drivers and passengers on your snowmobile will also need to wear an approved helmet. \n\n* An entry-level snowmobile is a suitable choice for children and adults who have never used a snowmobile in the past or anyone who has little experience with snowmobiles. \n\n* A trail snowmobile is usually very easy to operate and often more affordable than other complex models. These are often a good choice for intermediate users that want to ride on snow-covered terrain and trails. \n\n* A sport trail snowmobile will have more advanced features and better horsepower than a beginner or trail model. These snowmobiles are designed for use by advanced users. \n\n* Other types of snowmobiles include performance, touring, and mountain snowmobiles which are all designed for use by those who can operate more complex models. They are a good option for using a snowmobile during a competition or when you want to travel a great distance. \n\n* There are a few risk factors to consider when buying a snowmobile. Even if your budget allows you to spend top dollar, you should always be realistic about what type of snowmobile you need. If you are new to using a snowmobile, you shouldn't purchase a Sport, Touring, or Trail model just because you have the cash to do so. \n\n* When you buy a used snowmobile, you may pay much less, but if the engine is not in good condition, or it has too many miles on it, you may not save as much as you had initially expected due to necessitated repairs.

Here's a list of 10 of the strangest phobias out there along with a short explanation of each one.\n\n1. Vestiphobia: Fear of clothing. This phobia usually refers to the fear of a specific type of fabric or garment, possibly due to an allergy or traumatic incident. For example, players develop a fear of their sports gear after facing a traumatic incident. In some cases, this can come from the fear of tight, constrained clothing that makes one feel compressed and uncomfortable in public.\n\n2. Chaetophobia: Fear of hair. This phobia involves fear of one's own hair, other people's hair, and even animal fur. Patients are known to avoid haircuts, combing their hair, washing their hair, picking up hairballs, and touching hair in general as they may feel sickened by the very nature of hair. This phobia can be developed by traumatic haircuts or hair loss incidents\n\n3. Linonopobia: Fear of strings. This could include the fear of strings as well as anything resembling a string such as ropes and shoelaces. Patients could panic at the sight of these objects as they may trigger some painful memories of being forcefully tied up for punishment, captivity, or other related purposes.\n\n4. Globophobia: Fear of balloons. This phobia usually refers to the fear of the popping sound a balloon makes. Many find themselves uncomfortable around balloons, just because of that sound and how it can catch them off guard. In most cases, a childhood memory of this frightening sound is the cause of this phobia.\n\n5. Nomophobia: Fear of being without your phone. This phobia is triggered when patients lose touch with their phone or find it low on battery or service. They'll develop extreme anxiety over not being able to check their notifications. This phobia is usually a symptom of phone addiction, which is common among the modern generation.\n\n6. Optophobia: Fear of opening your eye. This phobia enables patients to feel discomfort with the simple act of opening their eyes. As a result, they usually prefer to stay indoors and away from brightly-lit areas as it can be severely inconvenient to perform daily tasks without opening their eye.\n\n7. Ephebiphobia: Fear of adolescence. This phobia triggers the fear of the youth demographic, specifically teenagers. Patients might be led to believe that teenagers are dangerous, violent, or untrustworthy, so they choose to avoid them and stay away from areas populated by teenagers.\n\n8. Pogonophobia: Fear of bearded people. This phobia ignites nervousness around beards due to unpleasant experiences with bearded people or just the concealing nature of beards themselves. Patients with this condition struggle to talk to bearded people properly or even look at their faces.\n\n9. Decidophobia: Fear of decision-making. Making tough choices is generally intimidating but it's a matter of mental health for those struggling with this phobia. they won't easily rely on their instincts, opinions, and judgments, and would much rather take advice from external sources such as friends, family, or the internet.\n\n10. Arachibutyrophobia: Fear of getting peanut butter stuck on the roof of your mouth. Those who consume peanut butter frequently are aware of this sensation where the substance gets stuck in your upper mouth. It causes an unpleasing and discomforting feeling that's hard to get rid of. So, patients suffering from this condition tend to avoid peanut butter and other sticky edibles.", "role": "assistant"}], "category": "Brainstorm"}
{"prompt": "Do you have any suggestions for effective ways to freshen a mattress?", "prompt_id": "8e1c62a756e0a7f66bcb374fc932f6f9c3160c3c455da8af104dd26cf254bced", "messages": [{"content": "Do you have any suggestions for effective ways to freshen a mattress?", "role": "user"}, {"content": "Here are a few good suggestions on effective ways to freshen up a mattress. \n\n1. Vacuuming - You can use the upholstery attachment that comes with most standard vacuum cleaners to eliminate dust and germs from eh surface. Before you start to use your vacuum, you should wash your upholstery attachment using warm water. Doing so will get rid of any dust and germs that are present inside the attachment from past use. You should vacuum your mattress surface, the sides, and the areas beneath the seams. Once that is finished, prop up your mattress and vacuum the other side. \n\n2. Deodorizing - Whenever you deodorize your mattress, you are eliminating any odors left behind by germs, bacteria, and allergens. You can use a few times you already have in your pantry to deodorize your mattress such as baking soda, water and vinegar, or cornstarch. \n\n3. Promoting Good Air Circulation  - A damp mattress is one that will invite harmful bacteria, mildew, mold, mold spores, dust mites, and others to accumulate on the surface. Even the smallest amount of body sweat can cause these issues to occur. You can prevent a lot of problems with moisture by promoting good air circulation. If you have a ceiling fan over your bed, you should keep it on for several hours after you wake up. Doing this will help eliminate traces of moisture from the surface of your mattress. \n\n4. Rotate Your Mattress Regularly - Rotating your mattress regularly will help keep the filling inside distributed evenly. It allows you to provide better support and consistent comfort while reducing the risk of dips or sagging in the mattress. Whenever you rotate your mattress, you are ensuring that you use each side equally. It is an excellent way to improve the lifespan and is a general part of your mattress care. \n\n5. Change Your Bedding Weekly - Changing your bedding every week can be very beneficial. Every week we spend between 49 to 60 hours sleeping and that is a lot of time for dirt, sweat, and oil to build up on our sheets. Proper hygiene is necessary in all areas of our life, including our bedding. Without regular cleaning, unwashed sheets can lead to skin breakouts, asthma, and allergies. To improve your health and your sleep quality, you need to wash your bedding regularly. \n\n6. Consider The Overall Health Of Your Mattress - Mattresses are not cheap; therefore, the overall health of your mattress is essential if you want your mattress to last as long as possible. You need to consider keeping up its health. From cleaning to prevention, taking the time to care for your mattress and perform some maintenance can help you prolong its lifespan. A few things you can do to improve the health of your mattress include making sure it is adequality supported, using a mattress protector, washing your bedding regularly, and rotating your mattress often.

Please don't suggest overly flashy or expensive ideas like proposing on a private yacht, or hiring a famous musician.", "role": "user"}, {"content": "Proposals can be an exciting event and often mark the start of a happy relationship. Here are some proposal ideas below:\n\n\u2022 Photo Book Proposal\nGenerally, for this marriage proposal method, a photo book would show a timeline of the couple's relationship from as early as the couple's first photo together to their most recent photo. Having a series of photos showing shared vacations, memories, and trips can remind the couple of the times they went through together. This method of proposing offers the couple the ability to save the proposal throughout time through the preservation of the photo book, something most other proposal methods do not offer. Photo-book proposals may also be easier to plan and keep secret than other elaborate methods involving remote locations or various people since the required items can usually fit in smaller spaces. Fortunately, there are a lot of shared experiences online that you may reference for ideas or research, ranging from the style of the photo book layout to something more complex like small battery-powered music speakers embedded in the photo book.\n\n\u00a0\u2022Vacation Proposal\nVacation proposals are another common method many people use to propose. A great benefit to this method is that it is often less susceptible to suspicion by the partner, especially if the vacation was not already pre-planned. For this method, some details are crucial to solidify before the actual vacation, such as the exact proposal spot, itinerary details, backup plans in the event of unforeseen delays or cancellations, and supplemental materials (e.g., the wedding ring, outfits on the day of the proposal, photography schedules, etc.). Fortunately, most vacationers are already in happ during the vacation, and proposing during one can leave a positive lasting impression for years afterward! However, this method of proposing may require more precise planning and engagement than others on the list, especially if you do not currently have a vacation already planned.\n\n\u2022 Romantic Dinner Proposal\nRomantic dinner proposals may also be a great option for you. This method offers high flexibility in that you would be able to choose a particular date, time, overall budget, and restaurant. You would also have great control, even until the day of the proposal. For example, if there was sudden inclement weather forcing the outdoor restaurant to abruptly close for the day, you can simply reschedule the reservation to a different date of your choosing. You would also have flexibility in choosing the restaurant, being mindful of any favorite dishes, allergies, or sentimental meals shared in the past. Many people who proposed using this method also planned supplemental details such as reserving the entire restaurant to create a private dinner, avoiding any crowds, having hidden photographers take pictures of the proposal moment, or inviting a personal small band to serenade the couple during the dinner. Some people elect to modify this method and change the location from a restaurant to a bar or dessert shop. Depending on the complexity and scope of the dinner proposal, the time it takes for preparation can range from just one day to a few weeks, with all final decisions being up to you.\n\n\u00a0\u2022Sentimental Proposal\nMost likely, couples will have a shared sentimental memory or experience. For example, did you and your partner meet at an unusual or memorable location that you both talked about? Or perhaps there was an accident or coincidence that introduced you to your partner at the beginning of the relationship. This method of proposing may require great thought and careful planning, especially if the sentiment is based in a location that is no longer easily accessible. Similar to the romantic dinner method of proposing, sentimental proposals offer an extremely high degree of flexibility and control over the proposal, allowing you to modify the proposal execution based on any restrictions. For example, if you and your partner met at a restaurant that is now permanently closed or would be unrealistic to travel to, you can opt to substitute travel to the restaurant with cooking the meals at home or temporarily redecorating the inside of your home to match the restaurant theme. Your imagination is the limit for sentimental proposals, as there is often no limit to the degree to which you can improvise with this method of proposing. One important consideration for this method is that it may require more thoughtful reflection, and since each couple usually has shared memories or experiences unique to them, outside research may not apply to your specific situation.", "role": "assistant"}], "category": "Brainstorm"}

The park offers outdoor activities such as hiking, camping, fishing, horseback riding, and more. The weather is generally moderate below 9,400 feet in altitude, but the higher you travel in elevation, the colder and more unpredictable the weather can become. \n2. Breckenridge, Colorado. This ski town offers a wonderful outdoor Colorado experience year-round. During the fall/winter seasons, skiing, snowboarding, and snowshoeing are popular outdoor activities. During warmer months, Breckenridge offers hiking, fishing, biking, camping, and more. Due to the high elevation of 9,600 feet, the temperatures are moderate throughout the year. \n3. Durango, Colorado. Durango is situated outside of the San Juan Mountain Range in Southwest, Colorado, offering stunning views of these mountains year-round. Because the elevation in Durango is lower, at 6,500 feet, the summer months are much warmer than many other places in Colorado. However, Durango is cold and snowy for the majority of the fall/winter seasons. Durango offers many outdoor activities, such as hiking, camping, fishing, and white-water rafting, and it is a smaller ski destination during the cold months.

I need a bullet-point list of 4 ideas, please.", "role": "user"}, {"content": "No problem! Here are some ideas on how to use the land at your apartment complex:\n\n* A dog park: If your apartment is pet friendly, a dog park is a great way to utilize the free space you have. Dogs who live in apartments don't get to enjoy the freedom or have the space to run around as dogs with fenced-in yards do, and they are often required to be leashed when they are on the apartment grounds with their owners. A fenced dog park allows dogs to have more freedom, run around safely, and play and socialize with other dogs. The pet parents at your complex will thank you!\n\n* A picnic area: Having a communal picnic area at your apartment is a great idea. You can install a communal grill and picnic benches, giving your residents a place to gather and enjoy time outside instead of being cooped up inside. This also helps foster a sense of community where neighbors can get to know and befriend one another. If your tenants have their friends or family over for a gathering at the picnic area, this is a great way to show off your amenities to the wider community, which can in turn lead to more interest in your apartments. \n\n* A playground: A play area is a great way to attract renters with young children and will be a popular addition for children already residing in your apartments. There are many kinds of play equipment you can install, including swings, slides, and climbing equipment. Make sure that the playground has a soft surface such as sand or solid rubber to ensure safety. \n\n* A garden: One of your vacant grassy areas could be transformed into a beautiful garden. Whilst living in apartments, it's hard to find peace or privacy and sometimes you might just need somewhere relaxing to be alone with your thoughts. To achieve this, you could create a tranquil garden area for the residents to sit in and admire. Plant some trees and flower beds, install a fountain or water feature, and add some wind chimes and benches. This will help your apartment look more attractive and cared for to potential future residents.", "role": "assistant"}], "category": "Brainstorm"}

Figuring out organic traffic helps you find out how visible your site is when keywords are searched on Google.\n\u2022 Click-through rate - There\u2019s also a click-through rate, which is somewhat similar to organic traffic. This rate references what percentage of people clicked on your site from SERPs. This metric helps you find out if your page is attention-grabbing. You can garner attention with a good title, URL, and meta description.\n\u2022 Pages per session - This metric reads how many pages people view on average before they click off your website. It\u2019s always good to have people who stay around and visit several pages. To increase pages per session, you want to make sure the content you produce is relevant and engaging. It also helps to make things easier to navigate.\n\u2022 Site speed - Your site speed, or how long it takes to load, is an integral factor used in SEO. It\u2019s important to check how fast your site runs on average so you can fix it if there are any problems.\n\u2022 Core Web Vitals - More and more, Google is focusing on user experience. This has to do with how fast pages load and how well they load. The three primary core web vitals that Google looks at are first input delay, cumulative layout shift, and largest contentful paint.\n\u2022 Backlinks - Backlinks are also important to Google in terms of their SERP rankings. The more people link to your site, the better it will perform. Backlinks are also judged by quality, so if it\u2019s a high-quality site linking to you, it can do tons to boost your SEO.\n", "role": "assistant"}], "category": "Brainstorm"}

Your Perspective - The most important factor to consider when choosing which college you will attend is how the school makes you feel while you're there. It doesn't really matter about their programs, opportunities, and scholarships if you don't feel like you belong. The right college for you will provide an environment that is challenging to you but will also help you realize that your dreams are within your reach. \n\n2. Internship Opportunities\nHaving some hands-on experience in the field you are interested in will not only help you learn more about your future career, but it is also a great way to help you discover your passions and expand your network. Check out what internships, hands-on opportunities, research, and opportunities to study abroad the colleges on your list have to offer, and be happy with those that you are most interested in. \n\n3. Safety \nNot only is safety a priority on campus, but it should also be a major factor when considering the safety of your surrounding area. What types of safety measures does the school put into place? What are the surrounding towns and neighborhoods like? Knowing more about the school's safety procedures and policies when it comes to student safety can be useful when it comes to deciding if the school in question is your best fit. \n\n4. Academic Support and Career Services Offered \nHow a college assists its students with academics is a very important factor in terms of what kind of education you will be getting. There are some schools that offer very little support and only want to provide an environment of independence, while other schools will offer things like free tutoring or writing assistance. Additionally, knowing what the school's placement rates are for jobs and postgrad schools are critical things to consider, because it offers an indication of the overall success and depth of their programs. \n\n5. Campus Life \nThe school spirit and the general atmosphere will set the tone for your experience while on campus. Ask important questions such as \"How many students live on campus?\" or \"What is there to do on the weekends?\" These are all questions that will give you a better understanding of college life for students who attend school there. \n\n6. Athletics and Extracurricular Activities \nIf you are interested in extracurriculars such as theatre, music, or student government, or if you love to play sports, college is an excellent time to explore brand-new passions and re-develop old hobbies. The right school for you will have the opportunity for you to do both. \n\n7. Majors and Minors \nEvery school has a different curriculum so you should consider what you want to get out of it while you are there. Are you hoping to take classes that are very specific to one discipline or more diverse experiences? You will also want to determine which majors, minors, and concentrations are offered at each school you're considering. \n", "role": "assistant"}], "category": "Brainstorm"}

You can use an eggshell as a growing container indoors, planting in the seedling, waiting for it to germinate and grow, and then transplanting it to an outdoor garden. It will save you on planting container costs and will be a source of calcium for the plant.\n2. Garden mulch. Crush the eggshells and then carry them straight out into the garden to mulch. On decomposition, they'll aerate the soil and provide essential calcium to the soil.\n3. Feed the eggshells to your chicken. Calcium-deficient chickens resort to eating their eggs to get the nutrients they need. To avoid this, crush up the eggshells that you have, bake them at 275 degrees, crush them even further, then feed them to the chickens.\n4. Use them to deter pests. You can also use crushed eggshells as protectors against slugs and snails. Just put them around the base of the plants to deter the pests from devouring your lovely greens.\n5. Add them to the compost. Improve the quality of your compost by adding egg shells. They are a great source of calcium and will make it so good for your garden.\n6. Wild bird food.

The fact that you're asking this question shows that you want to put in the effort to have a healthy relationship. Here are some things you can do to mend fences with your spouse and begin to move on:\n\n1. Communication - One of the most important aspects of a relationship, communication ensures the couple is talking to each other, expressing their feelings, and letting the other person know what they were thinking when they decided to do something. Many times problems in relationships are due to poor communication or a misunderstanding between two people, which could have easily been avoided had they opened up to each other about what was going on. In some cases, telling someone something may hurt their feelings, but being honest is the best course of action when dealing with an upset spouse as lying can make things much worse and put a strain on the relationship.\n2. Take timeouts - Sometimes being around one another for any extended period can cause feelings of claustrophobia and a sense of loss of privacy. Being around the same person every day, every minute of the day can cause partners to resent each other, especially if they don't have time for themselves to think and process feelings. If you're having problems with your spouse and you feel it getting worse by talking, consider taking a timeout so you can gather your thoughts and have some time to settle your emotions, before you end up saying something that you regret later.\n3. See a therapist or counselor - Sometimes the problems between spouses are not getting resolved through communication or timeouts, which is where a counselor can come in and provide some much-needed counseling and guidance to the couple. Having a trained, qualified outside observer who is separate from the turmoil and stresses the couple is experiencing can help to put things in perspective for the couple who are not able to see the forest for the trees.\n4. Don't be too proud to apologize - When couples argue, there may be a power struggle between the two where neither of them wants to concede the argument. Instead of letting your or her pride get in the way of reconciliation, apologize for whatever you did wrong and make amends. Or, if your spouse doesn't want to apologize for what they had done to cause the argument, simply forget about it; but before you drop the subject completely, at the very least let your partner know how their actions or behavior made you feel so you don't continue to harbor any bad feelings toward them going forward.", "role": "assistant"}], "category": "Brainstorm"}

Look for info dumps: Look for large chunks of writing in your story and ask if the details are truly needed. If so, is there another way you can convey this information? \n\n5. Edit for sensory details: Remember to show, not tell when writing descriptions. Check for details relating to each of the five senses, and use strong verbs rather than adverbs. \n\n6: Clean up dialogue: Red your dialogue carefully to see if it feels natural and sounds like something someone would actually say. Also, check for overuse of dialogue tags like \"she said,\" or \"they yelled.\" Consider replacing some dialogue tags with action beats.\n\n7: Remove repetition: Pay attention to how your sentences start, and make revisions so that they don't all start the same way. \n\n8: Proofread: Once you've performed the other editing steps, you can check for spelling, punctuation, and grammar mistakes.

", "role": "user"}, {"content": "Sure! If you've ever gotten so consumed in a task that you forget about the outside world and completely lose track of time, you were likely in a state of flow. It may be commonly referred to as being \"in the zone.\" \u201cFlow\u201d and \u201cflow state\u201d are both terms frequently used in psychology and happiness research. Achieving flow is different than daydreaming, but activates the same part of the brain called the default mode network (DMN). The brain is relaxed when daydreaming, or doing nothing essentially. Interestingly, even though the brain is putting in thoughtful effort in flow, it is enjoyable and relaxing to the brain rather than feeling like work. It actually suppresses anxiety and frees up other parts of the brain to make meaningful connections. \n\nAs the understanding of flow increases, more and more people are looking to see how they can achieve flow. Here are some things you can do to set yourself up to flow: \n\n1. Set clear goals: First, it\u2019s important to have a defined goal involving the task at hand. A finite goal is more beneficial than a time-oriented goal, as it is more likely to emit a feeling of accomplishment once the goal is met, or the task is finished. \n2. Find things that are the right amount of challenging: If a task or activity is too difficult, it\u2019s hard for the brain to be relaxed enough to be in a flow state. However, the brain needs enough challenge for the brain to see it as interesting and engaging.  \n3. Create an environment for focus: This means doing what you need to do to eliminate distractions. This also includes carving out time to achieve flow where you know you won\u2019t be interrupted. \n4. Don\u2019t forget about self-care: Oftentimes in a flow state, people don\u2019t feel thirsty or need to use the bathroom or end up sitting in the same position for a long period that\u2019s not necessarily ergonomic friendly. In order to achieve longer-lasting flow states and take of yourself at the same time, invest the time or energy into getting set up right by doing things like having water readily available or sitting in a proper ergonomic chair. \n5. Put away your phone: This deserves a category in itself because our phones can be the biggest distraction. Turn it off, switch it on do not disturb, or keep it out of sight. Do whatever you need to do to not be tempted to pick up your phone. \n6. Develop a pre-flow ritual: This can involve a number of things like checking your email and messages before tuning in to your work or activity, putting on a designated playlist, doing jumping jacks, etc. It\u2019s more about whatever works for you to clear your mind and set you up for focus. \n7. Get to know yourself: It may take a bit of trial and error to find what works best for you to achieve flow. You can\u2019t enjoy everything, but you can make most things enjoyable by knowing what motivates you and helps you get into a state of flow. \n\nPsychology experts have determined that flow is associated with increased dopamine, which plays a huge role in regulating mood and motivation. It's also been determined that you can go in and out of flow and have multiple flow states per day, but 90-120 minutes is an optimal flow state for many people. It\u2019s good to want to achieve flow as often as possible in whatever you are doing for overall health and well-being. ", "role": "assistant"}], "category": "Brainstorm"}

The idea is to give yourself extra time to think about the purchase before you make it.\n2. Leave them at home so that you are forced to use cash or come back later to purchase something. This also allows you extra time to reconsider.\n3. Close your account, but beware that this might negatively affect your credit score. You'll want to make sure you're not closing an account you really need.\n4. Shred your cards. You'll still need to pay your accounts, but the card won't be available. In the future, your credit card company can issue you a new card once you've learned to control your spending habits.\n5. Give yourself a shock by looking at the amount of interest you pay each year and the amount of time it will take to pay off the debt by paying the minimum. Your credit card statements contain this information.\n6. Reward yourself for reaching your goal of not using your credit cards. Start small, perhaps by indulging yourself a little after a week of not using your cards - but be sure to use cash so you don't undo the good you've done so far!\n7. Tell yourself no. If you've ever broken a bad habit in the past, you can use the same technique.

Its dark, ominous setting and minimalistic soundtrack will feel familiar to Limbo players. As with Limbo, there are many dangers that befall the player- character, and some are violent. Inside is rated \"M\" for mature and is not advisable for children.\n\n- **Unravelled** (2016) is a puzzle-platform game without the horror of Limbo. Instead, a cute yarn creature must solve puzzles and avoid predators by unraveling the yarn substance of its body. Similar to Limbo, the player must manipulate objects along the path, climb, swing, and cleverly avoid danger while picking up collectibles. It is a family-friendly experience. A sequel, Unravel Two, was released in 2018 with a two-player option.\u00a0\n\n- **Contrast** (2013) takes place in a noir setting but with an added Limbo-like shadow manipulation. Dawn, the player character, can slide in and out of the shadows to solve puzzles and assist the storyline characters. Despite being told from the point of view of a child, the story contains some adult themes and violence.

Tell him to lie on his stomach and give him a head-to-toe rubdown that soothes his senses with scented lotions, like lavender or eucalyptus. \n\n\u2022\tInvest in things that will help him unwind and relax after a long day of work. \n\nYour husband has his favorite things that help him relax after a workday, so keep those stocked for when he comes home. For instance, his favorite after-work snacks and drinks could be signs of care and appreciation! \n\nAnother great investment for a hardworking husband is an ottoman. When he gets home and takes off his work boots, give him a comfy space where he can put his feet up and watch some television before bedtime. \n\n\u2022\tLeave sweet notes of appreciation and love in his lunchbox. \n\nWords matter. Show your husband that you care and appreciate all he does with surprise love notes in his lunchbox. They are fun to find and will give him a boost of romantic feelings for you! \n\n\u2022\tPlan a day that\u2019s all about him! \n\nWhat does your husband love to do? Bowling? Movies? Drinking good beer with good friends at the best bar in town? Treat him to his faves! Take him on a date for a whole day and include all of the things that he loves to do. \n\nWhen you two get home, let him dictate how the night goes. You can spend more time together or go your separate ways to focus on other hobbies and interests. \n \n\u2022\tAlways kiss him hello, goodbye, and goodnight! \n\nTouch and physical affection will always be the best go-to methods for showing your husband how much you care. \n\nWhen he comes home, kiss him to convey that you are happy to see him.

Brushes - As a beginner, you do not need many brushes, it is best to master a few basic sizes before branching out to more costly options. A variety of one or two small, medium, and large round brushes will be enough to begin with. \n\n3. Turpentine or Mineral Spirits - Oil paint does not require water for brush cleaning. Instead, you use a paint-thinning solution to clean excess paint from the bristles. Turpentine is a commonly used phrase for this substance, but mixtures of odorless mineral spirits are a common alternative. Be sure to work in a well-ventilated area as these liquids can be harmful.\n\n4. A jar for cleaning brushes - You will need a glass vessel with a lid to store your turpentine or mineral spirits for cleaning. Ensure the vessel has a secure lid to seal in the vapor when not used.\n\n5. Linseed Oil or Oil Medium - Much like mineral spirits and turpentine, linseed oil will dilute oil paint. However, as it is oil-based, it creates an ideal consistency without sacrificing the paint\u2019s texture when painting. You can use this in the same way you would use water to thin-down other paints, such as watercolors.\n\n6. Rags - Rags are used to wipe your brushes after cleaning once you have dipped them in your jar. \n\n7. Palette - You will need a clean, hard, non-porous surface to decant and mix your paint on.\n\n8. Painting Surface - Any surface can be painted with oil as long as it is primed with Gesso.

What are some ways I can get started on a journey toward sobriety?", "role": "user"}, {"content": "Seeking sobriety is a notable endeavor and one that need not be tough or complicated as long as you know what to do and how to go about doing it. Here are some ways you can get started on a journey to sobriety:\n\n1. Acknowledge that you have a problem, and proceed from there. This includes knowing who you are when you are sober and who you become when you are under the influence of alcohol. Be honest with yourself about how alcohol affects your life and what causes you to drink to the point of being hungover. You will find out a lot about yourself if you take the time to take an inventory of yourself.\n2. Find a support group or sponsor. You can go to an organization such as Alcoholics Anonymous, or you can even decide to form a group of like-minded people who are also on the journey to sobriety. Participate in activities that can replace drinking, such as hiking, watching a movie, or going to a nice restaurant.\n3. Consult with a physician or other specialist who can monitor your health while you embark on your journey. A doctor can ensure you are staying healthy during sobriety, and they can also detect any issues with your physical health (i.e., quitting alcohol \"cold turkey\" or abruptly after drinking for extended periods can also cause problems such as withdrawals and delirium tremens). Psychologists or addiction counselors can provide much-needed insight into the way you think while you are on alcohol and can unlock your potential to eventually quit alcohol for good.\n4. Drink more water. Drinking water can fill your stomach and make you feel full; it can also prevent hangovers if you decide to drink alcohol the night before. If you drink an alcoholic drink, drink it with ice to water it down, or have a glass of water after every drink to dilute the alcohol in your system and lessen the effects of a hangover the next day. If you choose to slowly cut down your alcohol intake rather than quitting entirely, drinking water and slowing down how much you drink will help you.", "role": "assistant"}], "category": "Brainstorm"}

Instead of dancing, have the kids move around, stomp, and roar like dinosaurs. Stop the music at random intervals. When the music stops, the kids should stay completely still in the position they are in. If the kids move before the music starts playing, they are \u201cout.\u201d The winner is the last kid standing. \n* Dinosaur face painting: Face painting is another timeless party activity that the kids will love, where they get their faces painted with non-toxic, non-permanent paint to resemble something else. You can hire a professional face painter, or if you have an artistic flair, you could even learn how to do it yourself. The kids will have a lot of fun watching themselves transform into their favorite dinosaurs, like the T-Rexe and Triceratops. \n* Dino pi\u00f1ata: Pi\u00f1atas are a favorite amongst both kids and adults at birthday parties. It involves suspending a paper-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 figure (the pi\u00f1ata) filled with candy in the air and then letting the kids take turns hitting the pi\u00f1ata in an attempt to break it. Once broken, the candy is released! There are many different pi\u00f1ata designs out there, including plenty that are dinosaur-themed. ", "role": "assistant"}], "category": "Brainstorm"}

I have an interview next week\u2026 what are four things that I can do to ensure that I have a good chance of being hired?", "role": "user"}, {"content": "Congratulations on the interview for your dream job! \n\nAs requested, the following four tips to ensure that you make a good impression to strengthen your odds of getting hired. \n\nGood luck! \n\n1. Be prepared with answers to commonplace interview questions. \n\nWhile no interview is the same as the one before it, there are commonplace questions that may be asked in each interview throughout your work history. For example: \n\n\u2022\tWhere do you see yourself in 5 years? 10 years? \n\u2022\tWhy do you want to work with our company? \n\u2022\tHow would past employers describe your work ethic? \n\nEven though you\u2019ve seen and been asked the same questions dozens of times, they can still throw you for a mental loop in a moment of nervousness. Prepare your answers beforehand. \n\nWhile not every question is one you can prepare for, there are topics that you know an interviewer will touch upon, such as your interest in the job and your skills for the position. Strive to have an outline of personal responses for anticipated commonplace interview questions and remember that you don\u2019t have to be perfect \u2013 just genuine.  \n\n2. Be aware of your body language and facial expressions during an interview. \n\nDon\u2019t be robotic, but don\u2019t be totally relaxed in your mannerisms either. Job interviews are professional settings where you strive to make a good first impression. Ergo, your body language and facial expressions should reflect your intent for and interest in the job. \n\nWork on a cordial handshake, make eye contact naturally with your interviewer and be attentive to control nervous tics, like constantly touching your nose or looking away. Interviewers understand that you are nervous, and nobody is perfect in how they cope with nervousness, but you should make an effort to leave behind a good first impression of professionalism and respect.  \n\n3. Do your research on the company and ask questions at the end of the interview. \n\nMost potential employers will ask if you have any questions at the end of the interview. This is where you can show attentiveness with proof of research. You should know the ins and outs of the role you apply for, but inquire about the workplace environment with questions like: \n\n\u2022\tWhat is your vision for the company? \n\u2022\tWhat are your expectations of behavior and productivity in the workplace?\n\u2022\tHow can I contribute to this role positively? \n\nWhen you ask questions following an interview, it shows potential employers that you are self-aware and have a genuine interest in the job. \n\n4. Memorize the details of your resume and have answers ready for questions about your job and education history. \n\nIt\u2019s amazing what you can forget the moment when someone asks you a question about your history. Sometimes the nervousness of potentially landing a dream job can overwhelm your senses, so memorize and practice beforehand. You\u2019ve lived your work and education histories, so you know them the best. Be prepared to answer questions about how well you did in education facets or what prompted you to leave one of your earliest work positions.", "role": "assistant"}], "category": "Brainstorm"}

Add a \u201csunny side up\u201d egg to a bowl of grits. \n\nWhen you have a heaping helping of grits in the mornings, put an over-easy egg on top. Then break the yolk and mix it around until bits of runny yolk and cooked egg whites are dispersed throughout the grits. The richness of the egg yolks combined with the buttery goodness of the grits will give your tastebuds an oomph of flavor and satisfying texture. \n\nAdditionally, grits are rich in iron while eggs are dense with protein and good fats. It\u2019s a nutritious, tasty breakfast all around! \n\n2. Deviled eggs are quick, yummy on-the-go foods. \n\nTo make deviled eggs, you boil whole eggs, peel them, and cut them in half, then scoop out the semi-solid yolks. Mix the yolks with mayonnaise, salt, pepper, sweet pickle relish, and a hint of yellow mustard. Then spoon the yolk mixture back into the center of each egg half. Sprinkle with paprika and voila \u2013 a delicious, nutritious, more flavorful way to eat eggs!\n\n3. Poach an egg and put it over an English muffin with hollandaise sauce. \n\nThis method of eating eggs is called Eggs Benedict and it\u2019s a savory way to enjoy a hearty breakfast. \n\nUsing water and a tablespoon of vinegar, crack an egg into the liquid and allow it to boil for 3 minutes, then scoop the egg out of the water with a slotted spoon. You can then place it on top of a toasted half of an English muffin with a spoonful of hollandaise sauce. To increase the flavor, you could also add smoked salmon between the egg and muffin before you spoon on the sauce. \n\n4. Toast, avocado, and eggs \u2013 simple, easy, and delicious. \n\nSometimes the best, most fulfilling breakfast is the simplest and easiest to prepare. Toast a couple of slices of bread to your liking and add sliced avocado on top. Then add an over-easy egg over your avocado. To spice things up, you could use a sprinkle of everything bagel seasoning on top of your eggs. Enjoy! \n\nSide note: Make sure you have a napkin handy since this play on eggs and toast can get a little messy when the egg yolks burst.  \n", "role": "assistant"}], "category": "Brainstorm"}

Also, medical or health issues are often valid reasons to avoid work and overall is a sensitive topic. It may be seen as tactless if follow-up questions from your manager are repeatedly asked surrounding absences caused by medical or health issues. \n\n2) Urgent family reasons\nMissing work due to family-related issues is another possible reason to provide your manager. The severity of the family-related reason(s) can vary widely from simple daycare substitute duties to death, however, you should emphasize that the emergency was unanticipated. Most people can relate to familial emergencies disrupting the normal flow of their personal life. Keep in mind, it would be important to remember any details you inform your manager of your family going forward. For example, if you say that you had to miss work to babysit your nephew, but mention a few weeks later that you have no aunts or uncles, you may be seen as dishonest and future genuine requests to take time off from work may be scrutinized. \n\n3) Car-related issues\nCar-related issues may also support your upcoming absence when you talk with your manager. This general reason is also relatable to those who have experience owning a car. Unexpected issues with your car may prevent you from commuting to work, and since you plan to only be off for two days, which is a reasonable amount of time to get most car issues remediated, this type of reason may be valid to provide. You should also be mindful of any personal details your manager might know (or will know in the future) that may conflict with this reason. For example, if you told your manager that you sold your car last month, then this reason will be revealed to be a lie and you may face disciplinary action from your manager.

", "role": "user"}, {"content": "Here are five creative ways you can save money.\n\n1. Join loyalty programs.\nOftentimes, people shop at the same places for regular purchases. An example is shopping at the same grocery store every week. If you are doing this, determining whether the places you shop have loyalty programs that reward consistent customers is well worth your time. These loyalty programs will allow you to gain rewards for future shops. In the long run, this can save you lots of money. If your grocery store doesn't offer a loyalty program, it's worth checking the closest one that does. Weighing up the cost of extra fuel and time to get there will help you to decide if it's worth trying somewhere new. \n\n2. Use cash-back credit cards. \nIf you are responsible with money and do not have problems paying off credit cards, look into getting a high cashback credit card. Like loyalty programs, this will help you get extra rewards for simply doing what you are already doing. Extra money with minimal extra work is always good when trying to save money. Often times you will receive cashback on just about anything, so using your cash-back card for all your purchases and then paying the balance straight off could lead to great returns over a long period. It is essential to remember to pay off your card as the interest you gain through not doing so will likely exceed your cash-back, leaving you worse off. \n\n3. Cancel subscriptions you are not using. \nCheck your monthly outgoings and see if there are any subscriptions you are not using. If you find any, it would be best off to cancel them. This will mean a monthly bill is removed, which is excellent as these monthly bills can add up to a lot over time. The quicker you cancel, the faster you save. Many TV or Telephone will even offer a lower rate to customers considering leaving. This means that contacting and informing them of your plans to leave could mean they offer you a significant discount to stay. Doing this yearly can really help to keep your bills down in the long run. There is no harm in saying you will leave unless your bills go down. They can only say no. \n\n4. DIY where possible. \nDoing DIY instead of hiring a tradesman can really save you a lot of money. These days it couldn't be easier to find tutorials and how-to videos online for most DIY projects. Ensure you watch these videos before purchasing any materials or tools to ensure you are confident in completing the task to a high standard. If you have a lot of time on your hands, this is one of the best ways to save money as you also learn a valuable skill that you can use as a second income. DIY doesn't just mean working at home, though. It can even mean taking your own coffee or lunch at home instead of buying it out for a higher price.\n\n5. Set up automatic payments for bills. \nLife is tough, and it's hard to remember everything. You shouldn't be charged fees when you forget to pay a bill. But unfortunately, late fees are a fact of life, and sometimes they can damage your bank balance. By setting up automatic payments for your bills, you can ensure you never get charged late fees or accrue interest on any account you may have. An added bonus is that this will save you time meaning you have more to make money. ", "role": "assistant"}], "category": "Brainstorm"}

However, on getting the man there, it turns out that he needs a very specific part he doesn't have. So, the character then has to go and either get that part or find someone to make it. Maybe the man goes on vacation while the character does this, so then he has to find some old recluse that no one knows where he lives. and eventually convinces him to help. The device gets fixed, and now the character can use it to get to the top of the mountain. \n3. The mountain is owned by a tribe of people who don't allow anyone there but their own tribe past a certain point. There is a way to become a member of the tribe, but this takes a lot of work and involves going through a certain number of trials. There could be any number of these, and they include anything from fighting a certain sci-fi animal without weapons, finding a way through a deep and dark cave system and coming out the other side, and so on.\n\nI hope that one of these ways works for your book or at least gives you some ideas!", "role": "assistant"}], "category": "Brainstorm"}

Here are some suggestions:\n1. Work on their salaries. Every employee wants to be appreciated and compensated the right way, so to reduce your turnover rates, be sure to offer good salaries to your employees. This can be in the form of paying at or above the market value and offering additional perks and packages to motivate them to stay.\n2. Get clear on the job roles and responsibilities. Employees don't appreciate working outside the scope of their work and want to do work that is clearly defined in their roles and responsibilities. Ensure that during the onboarding process, these roles and responsibilities are well explained and detailed to avoid this kind of conflict. \n3. Make your company culture well-known to all. Does your company embrace individual top performance, or is it fast-paced? Explain in detail and clearly the culture in your company to the employees before they are hired. This will set their expectations right.\n4. Hire with diversity. While taking in new employees, consider what their expectations are, and how they perform and fit into your company culture. Don't hire because they fit into your culture, but hire people with diverse opinions to avoid stagnant culture, and build one where innovation is encouraged.\n5. Create fun time for the employees. Host up team-building activities and other fun ideas that do away with boredom at work, and get your employee's minds relaxed. This will not only improve their productivity but will help them know their needs are well taken care of.", "role": "assistant"}], "category": "Brainstorm"}

Ask a lot of fun, silly, interesting questions! \n\nKids are naturally inquisitive and imaginative, and they have a lot going on in their minds at all times. Go around the table and ask questions that are fun, silly, and sometimes weird, like: \n\n\u2022\tWould you rather teach a bear to dance or ride a rhinoceros? \n\u2022\tDo you think unicorns toot rainbows and glitter? \n\u2022\tYou\u2019re a superhero.

Craft pieces of a story from one person to another until you either have your food or a complete story. \n\nInvoke the power of imagination when you suggest making up a story with your family. Everyone gets to tell a piece of the story in one or two sentences as they go around the table. Stories will get weird quickly, but they can be as short or as long as anyone wants them to be.

Leavenworth is famous for its more than a half million Christmas lights, music, and events. You can take a horse-drawn carriage ride through the town, go sledding, and enjoy hot cocoa by the fire.

While intended to give the player a sense of the scale of the game world, they can be a dull unnecessary chore. \n2. Repetitive side quests: The need to complete a repetitive task every time a section of the world is unlocked or the plot is progressed is detrimental to immersion and renders the game feeling perfunctory and diminishes player choice. \n3. Unnecessary strategic layer: In settings where the player is the commander of an army or leader of a faction, it may seem to make sense to provide a strategic gameplay element. This would have the player command troops, manage resources, and make decisions on behalf of their faction. However, this can be poorly implemented and can result in players wasting their time playing a bad strategy game instead of a good action or role-playing game. \n4. Unbalanced gambling minigame: Open-world games commonly feature gambling minigames where players can bet in-game currency. As these mini-games can be an afterthought and poorly balanced, they are frequently exploited by players to destroy the difficulty curve for themselves by gaining unlimited money. This is worsened as they would gain these infinite resources in a repetitive, uninteresting manner rather than by playing the actual game. \n5. Broken economy: Many open-world games feature a large variety of items and currencies, which are not always well balanced in terms of their value to the in-game economy.

I have generated some possible ceremonial rituals for your story. I have also considered how they might be manipulated to give your protagonist more time to gather evidence.\n\n1. The Appointment of the Jurors: Before the trial can begin, the jurors must be appointed. This is an elaborate process by which the eligible elders must present themselves and assent to their duty or recuse themselves. It can potentially be much more time-consuming if the eligible jurors are absent, say due to an illness or a distraction in the square.\n2. The Assent of the Judge: The judge must agree to the jurors that have been appointed. This is normally a quick formality, but it could be a significant roadblock if the judge refuses to accept certain jurors. This could be out of an expectation that they recuse themselves, for example in the event that the elder in question is supportive of your protagonist and thus may be biased. \n3. Prayers to Goddess of Justice: Prayers to the Goddess of Justice must be performed before every day of court. Most of the time this is a relatively brief affair, lasting no more than 15 minutes, but there is an extended version of the prayer that can take up to two hours.\n4. Purification of the Court: The grounds of the courtroom must be purified with special incense. This is normally in abundance as it is from the neighboring city of D'larn, but perhaps recent trade disruptions have made the supply irregular, even scarce. Court proceedings surely could not continue without the incense, giving your protagonist more time. \n5. Demonstration of Punishments: In order to impress upon the jury the weight of their decision, a demonstration of the maximum punishment that may be meted out by the court is performed. This however can be delayed or even prevented if the instruments or actors assigned to take part in such a demonstration are nowhere to be found. ", "role": "assistant"}], "category": "Brainstorm"}

{"prompt": "What are some good suggestions for steps to help someone get started with an exercise routine?", "prompt_id": "5dc703298ea3455d5fa496158caf81520204a33f80e1183bf66194a925f31774", "messages": [{"content": "What are some good suggestions for steps to help someone get started with an exercise routine?", "role": "user"}, {"content": "Here are some useful tips to use when you want to get started with a new exercise routine. \n\n1. Assessing What Your Fitness Level Is \nYou likely have a good idea of how physically fit you are. But by determining your baseline fitness scores, you can find out the benchmark to use to measure your progress. To assess your aerobic and muscular fitness, body composition and flexibility, think about doing the following. \n\n* Determine what your pulse rate is before and immediately after exercising such as walking for one mile or 1.6 kilometers. \n* Find out how long it takes to walk for one mile or how long it will take you to run for 1.5 miles or 2.41 kilometers. \n* Determine how many standard or modified pushups you can do at one time. \n* Determine how far you are able to reach forward while in the seated position on the floor with your legs in front of you. \n* Find out what your waist circumference is, which is the area just above your hip bones. \n* Determine your body mass index. \n\n2. Create Your Fitness Program \nIt can be easy to say that you plan to exercise every day, but you will need a plan in place if you want to stick to it. As you create your own personal fitness program, keep these factors in mind. \n* Think about your fitness goals. Are you starting an exercise program to help yourself lose weight? Or do you have something else motivating you such as preparing for a marathon? Having goals that are clear and not outrageous will help you gauge your progress while keeping you motivated. \n* Come up with a balanced routine. A good place to start is to get at least 150 minutes of moderate aerobic activity or 75 minutes of vigorous aerobic activity every week, or a combination of the two. The guidelines suggest that you should spread this activity out during the course of a week. For even more health benefits, and to assist with weight loss, working out for at least 300 minutes a week is ideal. \n*Start slowly and progress minimally over time. If you are just getting started with an exercise routine, you should start out carefully and progress slowly. If you have an injury or a medical condition, it is imperative that you consult with your doctor and get advice from them on how to design your fitness program. They can offer suggestions on how to improve your range of motion and enhance your endurance. \n* Increase activity by adding it to your daily routine. Finding the right time to exercise can be a challenge for anyone. To make this easier, you should schedule your time to exercise as you would any other errand or appointment. Plan to watch your favorite TV show while walking on your treadmill. Or you can read while riding on a stationary bike. \n", "role": "assistant"}], "category": "Brainstorm"}

This sheet-pan chicken is not only gluten-free and nut-free, but low-carb as well. \n2. Pressure-Cooker Salsa London Broil. Cut your steak into thirds and place it in the pressure cooker, then add salsa, sweet potato, carrot, and garlic. Lock the lid and pressure cook on high for 10 minutes.  Slice your roast, serve with veggies, and garnish with lime wedges and cilantro, if desired. This dish comes together quickly but has plenty of delicious slow-cooked flavor. \n3. Air-Fryer Chicken Pesto Stuffed Peppers. Cut peppers lengthwise in half, remove the stems and seeds, and heat them in your air fryer at 400 degrees Fahrenheit for 10-15 minutes. While that cooks, combine the shredded rotisserie chicken, brown rice, and pesto in a large bowl. When the peppers are ready, add the filling and return to your air fryer at 350 degrees Fahrenheit for about 5 minutes. Sprinkle cheese on top of each stuffed pepper and bake until melted.    \n4. Grilled Summer Sausage Salad. Brush sausage, zucchini, yellow squash, and peppers with olive oil and grill them over medium heat for 5-6 minutes. Remove them to a cutting board, then roughly chop and add them to a large salad bowl with your salad greens, sliced cucumber, and chopped celery. Add your dressing of choice and toss to coat for a delicious and refreshing gluten-free and nut-free meal.  \n5. Chicken and Asparagus Bundles. Flatten chicken breast halves, then wrap each one around five asparagus spears and secure them with toothpicks. Put them in a baking dish, add oil, lemon juice, and seasonings then cover and bake for 25-30 minutes. When the chicken and asparagus bundles are ready, combine cornstarch and chicken broth with your pan juices in a small saucepan and heat until thickened, around 2 minutes. \n\nThese are just five ideas to help you come up with a great dinner idea for you and your guest.

'Drive My Car' by the Beatles - This is a great tune to sing along to, especially in the parts where the lyrics mimic car horns and other traffic sounds.\n11.

She is a constant companion to Johnathan, from his rescue in Budapest to the fateful carriage-top battle at the end of the novel.

Try it with a witch hat or cat ears \u2013 a simple headpiece can instantly give your kiddo a Halloween vibe. It's a fun way to get in the spirit without committing to a full costume.\n\n2. Orange It Up: Who says you need a costume to rock some holiday-themed colors? Encourage your little one to incorporate some orange into their outfit \u2013 it works on everything from a bright sweater to some spooky socks. It\u2019s an easy (and affordable) Halloween look.\n\n3. Jewelry-making 101: Bond with your child while making a statement necklace or bracelet that screams Halloween. Gather some spooky charms or beads and string them onto elastic or wire. You can spend some quality time together while also getting festive!\n\n4. Bold Moves: Your little one doesn't need a mask or full-face paint to make a statement. A bold lip or dramatic eyeliner can be just as eye-catching! Have fun experimenting with different shades and patterns \u2013 from spiderweb-inspired liners to glittery lips \u2013 for a Halloween-inspired beauty look.\n\n5. Don't Let Your Nails Feel Left Out: Halloween isn't just about costumes, it's also about spooky nails! Use nail polish to create your creepy designs, from spider webs to monster claws, and have a mini nail salon day with your kids.\n\n6. Embrace the Pumpkin Spice: Who needs a fancy costume when you can rock a pumpkin tee? Grab some plain t-shirts from a local craft store and let your kids decorate them with paint, markers, or even glitter. It can be as simple or as elaborate as they want, and will still be ready for some Halloween fun!", "role": "assistant"}], "category": "Brainstorm"}

Can you give me some ideas for practices to use to attract and engage with my Instagram following?", "prompt_id": "f7815d900ad0e532c5ac8b59a581db50de06bf5d905ab6823938eb19ac65ee29", "messages": [{"content": "I am interested in using Instagram to market my brand and business. Can you give me some ideas for practices to use to attract and engage with my Instagram following?", "role": "user"}, {"content": "Here are a few practices used by Instagram influencers and business owners to attract and engage with their followers. \n\n1. Create an Effective Bio - One of the first things you should do to attract more followers on Instagram is to create an effective bio. You have a limited amount of characters to work with and one URL, so you need to make each word count. It may seem obvious that you should put your website's URL on your bio, however, if you do you will not have the opportunity to engage as much with your followers. Instead, it is better to use this link to direct people to a landing page that has a list of links to offer. By doing this, you can direct your followers to an endless number of links simply by pointing them to your bio. \n\n2. Use Organic Tactics to Enhance Brand Awareness - Growth hacking is a term that is used by many digital marketing experts. It is the process of trying out various online marketing strategies to find out which tactics work the best. While there are many applications and programs out there that are designed to help you boost your follower count fast, you may not always end up with followers who are genuinely interested in your brand or what your company has to offer. The best way to make sure your follower count grows is by using organic tactics. By choosing the right hashtags and keywords to add to your profile and your captions, you will guarantee your followers are there because they want to be and are interested in what you are selling. \n\n3. Create a list of Hashtags that Work - Hashtags are the keywords for your Instagram posts, and they play an important part in helping you increase traffic to your account. Create a list of hashtags related to your brand and keep them in a place where they are easily accessible. You can store them in your phone's notepad app, and you will be able to quickly cut and paste all your hashtags at once into your posts instead of having to type them in manually. \n\n4. Use Story Highlights - Story highlights on Instagram make it easy to save the best stories you have created and showcase them on your profile for your followers to view anytime. This is a great feature when you want to add more details to your profile page but you aren't able to due to limitations on character count. \n\n5. Make Each Caption a Mini-blog - Your captions are very valuable, and it's a good idea to plan and create intriguing captions that will get the attention of your target audience. Some customers may like a long caption that gives them more details about your company. Others may prefer to read a shorter post that features videos or graphics. Over time, you will eventually learn which option works best for your audience. \n\n6. Add a CTA To Your Posts - When you make an Instagram post, you want to include a call to action. There are many ways you can do this, and a CTA doesn't always have to be a sales push. You can ask your followers to like the photo, tag a friend who may be interested, or ask them to leave a comment letting you know what improvements they would like to see in your products. \n\n7. Take Advantage of Live Chat or Live Streaming - Sharing fun live-stream videos focused on your brand's products is an excellent way to get the word out to your target audience. Your followers can choose to get a notification whenever you go live, and they can also ask questions during your live stream. It's like an interactive infomercial that allows you to reach out to those who are interested in the products or services you have to offer. ", "role": "assistant"}], "category": "Brainstorm"}

Emphasis\nCreate emphasis in your Excel dashboard to ensure it stands out. You can do this using contrasting colors and different text, such as varying sizes and bold text. Emphasis will help your dashboard be easier to use and navigate. Avoid using bright colors; instead, opt for subtle shades, etc. To separate rows, you can use subtle color contrast to make the dashboard easier to read. \n\n2. Connect different elements. \nYou can visually show different elements on your dashboard and connect them with your alignment. Visualizing data is easier for us when it is formatted properly. Ensure your data is displayed in a way that is easy to read and understand. The use of shapes and charts can be beneficial here. \n\n3. Draw parallels and create associations. \nYour dashboard should be completely consistent concerning abbreviations and color usage. Standard abbreviations or shorthand, such as arrows and math functions, can make your dashboard easier to read and understand.\n\n4. Organise and create focal points. \nEnsure your dashboard is as helpful as possible by grouping content relevant to each other and creating focal points that catch the reader's eye and attention. An example of this is grouping Committed, receipted, and outstanding spend for a budget close to each other to ensure the reader knows that these metrics are dependent on each other and related to each other. \n\n5. Balance big and small elements.\nIf you have larger and smaller charts, then utilize them both. However, be sure to position them in a place that makes sense and align them so things look tidy. A large chart followed by a small chart followed by a medium chart looks tacky to try to align all 3 in one area.\n\n", "role": "assistant"}], "category": "Brainstorm"}

Set a color of a car to be on the lookout for, and keep a tally of how many cars of that color have been seen. Try switching up the color when things seem dull. \n8. Mad Libs. This may require a pen and paper, or even a mobile phone. Write a sentence or paragraph, leaving out certain words such as verbs, nouns, or adjectives and ask your child to fill in the blanks. Read the entire sentence at the end.\n9. The Alphabet Game. Try to find road signs with words that start with the letters of the alphabet. Start with A, move to B, and so on, until Z. Restart several times if necessary. \n10. I'm Going On a Picnic. Begin by saying \"I'm going on a picnic and I'm bringing\" and say an object. The next person must repeat the previous answers and add their own to the end. The longer the game goes, the more things must be remembered and repeated.

Contact information: In the event that his ID was lost or misplaced, contact information would make it easier for it to be returned to him.\n4. Equipment Qualifications: An asteroid mining operation may involve high-powered and dangerous equipment. It may be important to be able to verify that the operators are qualified to use certain equipment before proceeding. Subsequently, the ID might contain such information.\n5. Blood type and other medical information: A asteroid mining operation is a potentially very dangerous workplace. It may make sense to display his blood type and other medical information on his ID for quick reference.\n6. Security clearance: For safety and security reasons, some sections of the asteroid may not be accessible to all members of the staff. This could be limited to the security office and the reactor room. Alternatively, the restrictions on the asteroid may be sufficiently extensive to limit staff to their specific working areas, common areas, and personal quarters.

Here are some methods to try and help her learn to trust you:\n\n1. Let her make the first move - It may seem counterintuitive to ignore a kitty that you're trying to bond with, but this will actually help to pique her curiosity about you. Let her reach out to you, and make your first interactions brief and positive. \n\n2 Keep her coming back - create a relaxing and non-threatening environment, such as feeding time in a quiet room. Try offering treats and toys. Meal times can be the best times to try to interact.\n\n3. Slowly desensitize her - she will need some time to get used to the presence of humans. Even normal quiet things like doors opening and closing, or voices, can be scary to a semi-feral cat who is not used to being around people.\n\n4. Respect her space - make sure she has places to hide when she gets overwhelmed and don't try to interact with her while she's in them. It is important for her to have times when she can make herself feel safe so that she can gather the courage to step out more. Smaller spaces are better, as large spaces can also be overwhelming.\n\n5. Consider a calming remedy - catnip, pheromone sprays, plugins, and calming supplements can all be helpful for calming a kitty's nerves.\n\n6. Be patient - remember that although some semi-feral cats come around after a few weeks, normally it takes several months, a year, or even longer.

Here are 4 hairstyle suggestions for short natural African curly hair:\n\n1. Fade haircut - a fade haircut is characterised by gradually increasing the size of the hair, starting from very short (sometimes bald) on the sides of the head just above the ears, to relatively big on the top of the head. This haircut is gender-neutral and works well on all sizes of short African hair, as it can be styled into a low fade (with very short hair at the top) or a high fade (with relatively long or 'big' hair at the top).\n2. Cornrows - depending on the size of the hair in question, cornrows may be a good hairstyle option. Cornrows refer to plaits done from front to back, where hair is plaited in strands of three each, lying flat along the scalp.\n3. Afro - a popular hairstyle for short natural African curly hair is to comb it out into an afro. This entails using a wide-toothed comb with long teeth - called an afro-comb - to comb out the hair from root to tip. This enhances the body of the hair and gives the desired afro-look.\n4. Curly - accentuate the curls by using curl-activator gel or curl-activating shampoo and conditioner. A spritz of water may also help to enhance the natural curls. Before choosing to use chemicals on your hair, however, be sure to read the ingredients label and ensure compatibility with your skin and hair type. If in doubt, consult with your doctor, pharmacist, or hair specialist before using chemicals on your hair.", "role": "assistant"}], "category": "Brainstorm"}

Please give me a brief rundown of the genres of games that are available to play.", "role": "user"}, {"content": "Sure thing! Here is a brief overview of the different types of video games available to play:\n\n1. Role-Playing Games (RPG) - Role-playing games involve playing a fictional character (you can design an avatar of yourself to play in the game) in a certain setting (fantasy, dungeon, wasteland) and playing out a storyline that can organically evolve. The hallmarks of RPGs include an experience-based leveling system, equipment (weapons, armor) that can add attributes (faster running, increased resistance to damage), and quests (tasks that can be completed for experience, equipment, or in-game currency.)\n2. First-Person Shooters (FPS) - First-person shooters are shooting games that put you directly in the game character's shoes as if you were seeing everything through their eyes. FPS games usually revolve around either a single-player campaign where the player fights against enemies using a variety of guns through multiple levels, or in multiplayer online matches with other human players (Deathmatch, King-of-the-Hill, Capture-the-Flag, or Cooperative play).\n3. Fighting Games - Fighting games are games that usually involve two players (either a human against a computer-controlled character or a human versus another human) fighting against each other using many different fighting techniques, including hand-to-hand combat, weapons combat, and sometimes even superpowers such as laser beams or energy blasts. The winner of the match is the player left standing.\n4. Sports Games - Sports games are digital representations of sports that are available in real life (basketball, football, hockey). Sports games allow you to play as a player in a sports game, playing the game as it would be played in real life. Some of these games are made so well that every detail seems almost life-like, and may include real players from the real sports making cameos in the games as playable characters.\n5. Side Scroller/Platform Games - Side scroller and platform games are 2-dimensional games where the player controls a character who moves from left to right or vice-versa on the screen and must navigate obstacles such as walls or ladders through jumping (via platforms) or climbing. \n6. Multiplayer Online Battle Arena Games (MOBA) - MOBAs are games that are played online against multiple other human players in a game setting. The games usually consist of groups of players on separate teams attempting to beat each other either by eliminating the opposing team's players or by capturing an objective (such as a flag or castle). The difference between MOBAs and first-person shooters may seem small, but MOBAs do have added features such as different skills for players that can add new dimensions to the game and foster cooperation and communication between teammates to win a match.\n7. Action-Adventure Games - Action-adventure games usually involve playing a character in a situation that involves action and/or adventure, such as exploring caves or climbing mountains.\n8. Stealth Games - Stealth games require cunning and quiet to kill enemies and maneuver through the game environment. Many stealth games are based around characters that would require stealth to perform their duties, such as ninjas and assassins.\n9. Survival Games - Survival games are about playing a character who must survive in their surroundings or the environment. Game modes include surviving against multiple hordes of enemies such as zombies or other enemy combatants using weapons or tools designed to hurt or kill your enemies.\n10. Simulation Games - Simulation games allow you to simulate fictional or real-life scenarios in a game setting. Some examples of simulation games include simulating real life (owning a house, interacting with neighbors, making meals), being a farmer (operating a tractor, tending to the land, growing crops), or even pressure-washing dirty fences. There are many simulation games to choose from.", "role": "assistant"}], "category": "Brainstorm"}

Goolix - The Goolix is a Pikmin boss that looks like a blue amoeba. It fights by encapsulating Pikmin within itself, which will drown them. It is impossible to fight if you don't have blue Pikmin, but blue Pikmin can fight it without being injured. You can only find the Goolix after day 9 on odd-numbered days in the impact site,\n2. Burrowing Snagret - Snagrets are creatures that pop out of the ground and look like a mix between a snake and a bird. When they fight, they unburrow and eat several Pikmin and then burrow back down for safety. In the Forest of Hope, there are 3 Snagrets in the same location. The best way to fight a Snagret is to attack as they try to emerge from the ground. Then before it has a chance to shake them off, whistle them back.\n3. Beady Long Legs - Beady Long Legs - Arachnophobes beware, the Beady Long Legs is a massive spider. It stomps around, and Pikmin die as it steps on them. It also drops from the ceiling abruptly when you find it, which can immediately crush Pikmin. It helps to fight it with a smaller team of Pikmin, as large teams can more easily be crushed. It also helps to have Yellow Pikmin, as they can be thrown higher than others. This boss resides in the Forest Navel.\n4. Armored Cannon Beetle - The Armored Cannon Beetle is a boss that isn't labeled as a boss. This beetle has armor surrounding its body. It also has a blowhole that sucks in before it shoots out a boulder. The ball that rolls can crush several Pikmin and only stops when it hits a wall or other enemy. To fight it, you need to clog its blowhole, which will then make it expose its abdomen which can be attacked. Its blowhole can be clogged by Pikmin. You can find the armored cannon beetle in The Forest of Hope.\n5. Emperor Bulblax - This is the final boss of Pikmin. It looks like it's covered in sludge with moss growing out of it. The Emperor Bulblax waits in the ground for its prey and pops up as you pass by. To defeat this enemy, you need to use Yellow Pikmin to feed it bomb rocks. It fights by eating, and when it sticks out its tongue, you can throw the Pikmin with bomb rocks at it.

The Kulen Nature Trails are within the national park about an hour's drive outside of Siem Reap, where you can hike through the forest and see waterfalls and temples. \n\n2. Learn about the history and culture. \nOne of the best ways to get a glimpse into a country\u2019s culture is to take a local cooking class or to visit the Old Market to see where the locals shop. Go to the Cambodia Landmine Museum to learn about the troubling history and current repercussions of the war.

Then there\u2019s the Banteay Srey Butterfly Center where you can walk around with dozens of Cambian butterflies flying around you.\n\n4. Get pampered.\nLike many parts of Southeast Asia, there are massages and spa services available in most places for very reasonable prices. You can get a fish pedicure if you\u2019re after a more unique experience.\n\n6.

Even for non-allergic victims, this savage venom can be brutally fatal, which makes this insect particularly dangerous. \n\n2. Kissing Bug: Also known as vampire bugs, these bloodthirsty creatures bite their victims right around the soft tissues of their mouths. Their bite is known to carry the Chagas disease, which shows symptoms in 4 to 8 weeks and gets deadlier over time. Victims of the kissing bug are reported to be diagnosed with fever, swelling, and even heart disease if they're not cured in 10 to 30 years.\n\n3. Tsetse Fly: This notorious African bug is known to have an exceptionally ferocious bite that leads to victims suffering from sleeping sickness. This is a fatal disease with no easy treatment. Furthermore, a tsetse fly's bite can cause confusion, numbness, headaches, itchiness, and extensive trouble sleeping.\n\n4. Deathstalker Scorpion: One of the most dangerous scorpions in North Africa, the deathstalker scorpion's venom is comprised of four neurotoxins that can lead to instant heart failure. It's particularly deadly for children who can die from one sting if their bodies aren't treated with antivenom regularly.\n\n5. Assassin Caterpillar: Dominant in Brazil, this radiating caterpillar is a breed of furry moth that produces corrosive venomous bristles from its body.

Give me five tips on how to make it smell better! ", "role": "user"}, {"content": "There are dozens of reasons why an old house may smell a little musty, especially if it has been closed off for a few months, or even years. To get your new home smelling fresh again, follow the ensuing five tips for getting rid of \u201cold house\u201d smells. \n\n1. Open the windows immediately in every room to completely air out your house. \n\nThe number one cause of musty \u201cold home\u201d smells is stale air. Open every window in your home as often and for as long as you can to encourage the circulation of fresh air. It may take a few days, or even weeks, to fully replace musty smells with fresher, better air throughout your home, so be patient. \n\n2. Place a dehumidifier in key locations throughout your home and keep them running all the time. \n\nOne large dehumidifier can cover 3,000 square feet of space, so do the math of your new house and calculate how many you would need to cleanse the air of an entire home. Need two? Put one at one end of the house and one at the other, then keep them running continuously until you can smell and feel a positive, cleaner difference in the air. \n\n3. Cultivate a garden of houseplants that naturally cleanse the air. \n\nSome plants can naturally reduce indoor air pollutants by replacing musty smells with clean oxygen and earthy, leafy odors. Some air-cleansing houseplants to consider for your indoor garden include: \n\n\u2022\tEnglish Ivy. \n\u2022\tChinese Evergreen. \n\u2022\tDragon Tree. \n\u2022\tPot Mum. \n\u2022\tSpider Plants. \n\u2022\tLemon Button Ferns. \n\u2022\tAloe Vera\n\n4. Use small bags of activated charcoal to get rid of musty odors in old drawers, closets, and other walk-in spaces, like attics or basements. \n\nDid you know that one teaspoon of activated charcoal could dispel bad smells from an entire football field? One teaspoon of activated charcoal lasts for one month. However, for a particularly musty or foul-smelling house, you can change out activated charcoal bags every two weeks. \n\nThe baggies of activated charcoal should be fabric to allow for better, quicker absorbency of bad odors. Or you could simply place a small bowl of activated charcoal in each room but keep it away from pets and children to avoid accidental ingestion. \n\n5. Burn a combination of your favorite air-cleansing herbs and woods, such as sage, rosemary, and cedar. \n\nFor centuries, the act of burning herbs and wood in an old house has been a method of dispelling negative energies to make way for new beginnings. However, regardless of what you believe in terms of spiritual enlightenment, some herbs, and wood, like sage, rosemary, and cedar, can help eliminate certain allergens and smells, like mold, dust, and pet dander. \n\nWill it bless your home? Maybe. \nWill it bless your sinuses and help cleanse the air in your home? There\u2019s a good chance! \n\nBonus: Sage, rosemary, and cedar are uplifting fragrances, so there\u2019s a chance that your mood will improve as the quality of the air in your home does.

", "role": "user"}, {"content": "I can help with that! Here are some groceries to stock up on in preparation for oral surgery recovery:\n\n- Eggs: Scrambled eggs are easy to prepare and, as long they aren't overcooked, have a perfect texture for someone with sore teeth. They can be paired with lots of different flavors and can be suitable for breakfast, lunch, or dinner.\n\n- Oatmeal: Oatmeal makes a great healthy breakfast option for oral surgery recovery. It's extremely easy to prepare and can be mixed with cream, brown sugar, and cinnamon for a sweet treat. \n\n- Instant mashed potatoes: This is a staple for recovery from oral surgery. The texture is easy on the teeth, gums, and jaw, the flavor is mild and easy to pair with just about anything, and the carbohydrates in the potatoes help keep patients' energy levels up. \n\n- Yogurt: The soft texture of yogurt is easy on the mouth, but that's not the only reason to add it to your grocery list. While recovering from oral surgery, you may be prescribed painkillers and antibiotics. Both of these medicines can be tough on the digestive system, so the probiotics in yogurt can help prevent digestive discomfort if eaten daily. \n\n- Apple sauce: The texture of apple sauce makes it perfect for recovery from oral surgery. Plus, apple sauce makes a quick and easy snack at any time of day. It's healthy for a sweet snack, too, with a healthy dose of fiber and a relatively low calorie count.\n\n- Rice: If slightly overcooked, rice becomes very soft and easy to consume. You could add it to warm broth or soup for some extra texture, or make it into rice pudding for dessert.\n\n- Macaroni and cheese: Cook the pasta a little longer than the recipe advises to make this dish nice and soft. \n\n- Ice cream: You may not want to use ice cream to replace more nutritious meals, but the texture and temperature can be soothing to an inflamed mouth. Also, recovering from surgery can be quite unpleasant, so having some sweet treats in the freezer can help to keep patients' morale high. \n\n- Popsicles: Like ice cream, fruity popsicles can be soothing to the mouth due to their cold temperature. Popsicles may be a healthier alternative to ice cream, though.\n\n- Canned or jarred pur\u00e9e soups: You can find prepared soups in many different flavors, such as tomato, butternut squash, carrot ginger, cream of mushroom, and more. Just try to steer clear of soups with meat, whole beans, or large vegetable chunks in them. \n\n-Avocadoes: Once avocadoes are ripe and soft enough, they make a wonderful addition to other savory foods on this list like scrambled eggs or mashed potatoes. They are full of healthy fats, fiber, and protein. \n\n- Bananas: Let these fruits get a bit overripe and mash them before consuming. You can mix mashed bananas with yogurt or cottage cheese for a snack.\n \n- Tofu: Tofu is soft enough for oral surgery recovery, but can add a little extra texture to dishes like scrambled eggs, as well as extra protein.\n\n- Soft-cooked vegetables: Most vegetables, when overcooked, become soft enough that they can be mashed like potatoes. Some popular choices for oral surgery recovery are mushy peas, overcooked zucchini or squash, caramelized onions, roasted tomatoes, and sauteed spinach. Add these softened veggies to mashed potatoes, scrambled eggs, soft cooked rice, or macaroni and cheese for a full and nutritious meal. ", "role": "assistant"}], "category": "Brainstorm"}

Good leaders simply possess qualities that allow them to fill the role of a good leader, and these qualities can be taught. Here are some qualities of a good leader:\n\n1. Leading from the front - Good leaders lead others, rather than let their followers or subordinates do all the work for them. Good leaders set a good example for the rest of the group, and will never assign someone to do something that they are not ready to do themselves.\n2. Taking responsibility - Good leaders take responsibility for the bad choices they make, and the results (or consequences) of those actions. Rarely do good leaders shy away from blame, and they are always willing to share the praise they are given with the rest of the group. When they succeed, they succeed together; when they fail, they fail alone.\n3. Praise in public, reprimand in private - Good leaders will praise their subordinates in public for everyone to hear and see, but they will reprimand subordinates privately to prevent causing them shame or discomfort in front of their peers.\n4. Knowledge and wisdom - Good leaders have a good knowledge of what they're doing and what they expect others to know or do. They also have enough life experience to couple with their knowledge that acts as wisdom that can guide younger, less experienced subordinates in the right direction.\n5. Asking instead of ordering - Good leaders tend to instill trust and confidence in their subordinates. One way they achieve this is by asking subordinates to do tasks, rather than ordering them to do tasks. Ordering anyone to do something can come off as bossy and may cause some subordinates to rebel if they don't appreciate what they are being ordered to do; however, good leaders who ask their subordinates to perform a task are subtly getting them to \"buy in\" to the decision-making process.", "role": "assistant"}], "category": "Brainstorm"}

For a good bite to eat, you could visit the Plaka district, as it offers some great opportunities to enjoy traditional Greek food.\n\n2. Delphi: Delphi is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and was at one point considered the center of the ancient world. You can see the Oracle or the Temple of Apollo here. Delphi doesn't offer as much in the way of food, but it's surrounded by gorgeous mountains with a peaceful atmosphere.\n\n3. Mycenae: Another UNESCO World Heritage Site, Mycenae was once a powerful city that had a large part in Greek mythology. The Lion Gate and Treasure of Atreus are must-see locations.\n\n4. Santorini: Santorini is a beautiful island in the Aegean Sea. Santorini is also known well for its white buildings and blue churches. You can see stunning sunsets, succulent seafood, and beautiful beaches here.\n\n5. Crete: Of the Greek islands, Crete is known for being the largest, while also having a rich history of myth and legend. You can see the Palace of Knossos, which was believed to be the home of King Minos and the Minotaur. Crete also brings a wide variety of cuisine to the table. This includes traditional dishes such as dakos, kalitsounia, and boureki.\n\nAny of the above locations will bring you ample opportunity to see Greece's history, mythology, and food for the beauty that it all is.", "role": "assistant"}], "category": "Brainstorm"}

Marble backdrop - because the TV is smooth and dark, it can look nice against a stone or marble backdrop. Consider linoleum stick-on tiles or ceramic tiles that have a marble look.\n\n3. Greenery - arrange some houseplants around the TV, possibly with one or two trailing and framing the TV. The balance of nature with electronics can be pleasant.\n\n4. Build it in - if you can't build a compartment in the wall, consider a shelving unit that has doors that can be closed when the TV isn't in use. The decorations and books on the shelves will also help balance things out.\n\n5. TV backgrounds - putting a calm and serene background on the screen when it's not being watched is a great way to make your TV act like a piece of art and not just an appliance.", "role": "assistant"}], "category": "Brainstorm"}

Once a slot is filled, replace the slot with the name of the person who donated the respective amount. Repost the graph on the story each time a slot is filled so it continues to pop up on followers' feeds.\n7. Partnering with Franchises - Reach out to a local food franchise in your community and propose the idea of a fundraising partnership. The business will agree to share a percentage of sales from the date of the fundraising event with the cause. It's important to create flyers and spread the word about the event so that supporters are encouraged to eat that the franchise to increase sales.\n8.  Car Wash - Either partner with a local business or set up your own car wash in your driveway.\n9. Care Baskets - First create a theme for the care package. It can be related to an upcoming holiday or a relevant topic like Self Care. Visit an economic store to collect the supplies that the baskets will contain. Organize the baskets in an aesthetically pleasing manner and then resell them to supporters to make a fundraising profit.\n10. Spin to Win - A small spinning wheel can be purchased online.

Can you provide me a list of the top 3 things I should look out for when purchasing a home and give some explanations as to why they're important?", "role": "user"}, {"content": "1. Roof condition - This is an important thing that some first-time buyers may not think about. The first thing you want to know is how old the roof is and what it's made of. Upon learning what the roof is made of, you want to research how long that material lasts and compare that to how old the roof is. This will give you a better idea of how long it has left. Another good thing is to check if the homeowner has a roof certification letter. This letter entails the estimate of the lifespan of the roof typically over the next 2 - 5 years. If you're not confident doing your research, then hiring someone to do a roof inspection would be beneficial. This can often be confused with being bundled into a home inspection, so you want to make sure to hire someone that specializes in diagnosing roof conditions.\n\n2. HVAC condition - It will be good to ask about the type of heating and cooling system the home uses, also be sure to ask how old it is. A typical unit will last somewhere around the timeframe of 10-25 years, hence the importance of asking how old it is. If the unit is missing, shows signs of water damage, has suspicious-looking cracks, or weird sounds and rust, then that's a sign the unit most likely will not be in good working condition. If you still have concerns after checking for those signs then a home inspection would be recommended as they should be more than capable of finding any major issues.\n\n3. Plumbing - For this, there are three main things you need to look for. You'll want to see how fresh the sewer lines are, for example, if the home is 20 or more years old and you don't have any disclosures from the seller it will be beneficial to get a sewer inspection. There are things such as root growth and pipe disintegration that can cause major clogs and mess up the whole system. Next, you want to see how the toilets look. You want to make sure to check for leaks and also unstable bases along with discoloration. Don't be afraid to flush the toilet while you're at the home showing. The same goes for making sure the showers and sinks are working as intended. The final thing you want to check is the state of the water heater. Typically a water heater will last around 10 to 15 years, and when looking at the unit you may find the installation date written on it. If you notice unusual noises when it turns on or notice rust, it is highly recommended to have a professional look at it.", "role": "assistant"}], "category": "Brainstorm"}

If you are planning to use cloth diapers, think about how often you want to wash diapers, to determine the quantity you want to buy.  Otherwise, you will need a few pajamas with feet, a few pairs of socks, and a hat for summer or winter.  Dress-up clothes for newborns are always awkward, pajamas are just fine for the first three months or so!  Don't forget wipes, and a comfortable bag to carry baby's supplies.\n\n* If you drive, you'll need an infant car seat.  Make sure it's rear-facing, and properly attached.  If that feels like too much, ask a friend or family member for help installing it.\n\n* You'll need a cradle, crib, or bassinet, with a good mattress and some protection for it (mattress cover and sheets).

Some car seats detach from their base and become baby carriers. Other parents choose to carry their baby with a scarf or other sort of soft carrier.\n\n* How will the baby be fed?  If you are planning to bottle feed, you will need formula, bottles and a brush cleaner, and burp cloths. Bandanas make very cute bibs and burp cloths too!  If you plan to breastfeed, nipple cream, a nursing bra and breast pads are very handy.  You might also consider a pump if you plan for someone else to feed the baby at times, which means you would need to buy at least one bottle.  You can freeze your breast milk in an ice-cube tray in your freezer, and thaw it as needed.\n\nThis is the bare minimum you will need to welcome your baby home, the rest you can find a little at a time or as needed.

It can be difficult to understand the grant funding opportunities from the federal government. Here is a brief breakdown of four different types of federal grants. \n\n1. Competitive grants: Competitive grants are also known as discretionary funding. The awardee is not chosen beforehand, so the applicant must draft a comprehensive proposal to submit to the review board. Since these are \u201ccompetitive\u201d grants, there may be multiple organizations and individuals applying for a certain sum of money. \n2. Formula grants: For formula grants, awardees are predetermined. The formula is how grant money is mathematically dispersed among awardees. An example of this type of grant is when state governments are awarded federal funding, but then this allotted amount is broken down into different projects and incentives at the local level. \n3. Continuation grants: As the name implies, these are for grantees that desire to renew an existing grant and continue to receive funding for their projects. It\u2019s important to note that even though the grant money has been awarded in the past, it does not always guarantee continued funding. Those applying for continuation grants will sometimes be competing against those will new ideas and compelling proposals. \n4. Pass-through grants: Pass-through grants are issued by a federal agency, but dealt with by state governments. At the state level, the government has the autonomy to allocate funds where it is deemed necessary in the form of competitive or noncompetitive grants. \n\nBy first understanding these four types of federal grants, you or the organization you represent will know more about the funding at your disposal.

Consider giving your husband a sleep aid device \u2013 like a white noise machine \u2013 that will help him fall asleep quickly when he has a few minutes to a few hours before the next feeding.\n\n2.\tCoffee (Or tea/hot chocolate) Gift Baskets: If the sleep aid device is insufficient and he still needs extra caffeine create a gift basket of flavorful caffeinated beverages. This can include coffee, tea, and hot chocolate. You may want special mugs, stirring spoons, and a new coffee maker or kettle. If he spends much time away from home, you can also include gift cards to his favorite coffee houses.\n\n3.\tPersonalized Father Keychain: Personalized gifts are always a fantastic idea. Whether money is tight or you want to get him one more small gift, a keychain that says Father or Dad is a great idea. You can also get one from your child that says something like Daddy, I love you and the child\u2019s name.\n\n4.\tA daddy/baby matching outfit. This could be a t-shirt or t-shirt or sweatshirt for dad and a matching onesie or sleep-and-play for the baby. It is super cute when they go out or spend time together.\n\n5.\tMatching sports jerseys for daddy and baby. If daddy wants to watch football with their baby every Sunday, you should encourage him and get them matching jerseys. But them Brady, Mahomes, Allen, or Rodgers jerseys (or whoever his favorite quarterback or other player is). Of course, suppose your husband prefers hockey, baseball, basketball, soccer, or another sport. In that case, you can also get those types of matching jerseys.\n\n6.\tApple Air Tags: Becoming a parent can have many confusing or frazzled moments. This can include forgetting where you put essentials like your keys, phone, or wallet. Apple Air Tags are the answer to that issue! If he is not an Apple customer, you can get him Tile Mates, instead.\n\n7.\tFood Gifts: Most dads will not say no to chocolate and snacks like mothers. Create him a gift basket of his favorite treats, or get him a nice box of chocolates.\n\n8.\tA Book of Dad Jokes: Now that he is a father, it is time to learn the secret language of dads and master the dad joke.", "role": "assistant"}], "category": "Brainstorm"}

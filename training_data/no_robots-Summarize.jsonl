{"prompt": "Summarize Konstantin Stanislavski's system to train actors\n\nWHAT IS STANISLAVSKI TECHNIQUE?\n\nBorn in 1863, Konstantin Stanislavski was a Russian actor, director and theatre practitioner. Stanislavski Technique stems from his theatre practice and is still used by actors all around the world today. The method is an actor training system made up of various different techniques designed to allow actors to create believable characters and help them to really put themselves in the place of a character. Much of the technique centres around Given Circumstances and the Magic If; which I\u2019ll look at in a little bit more detail below.\n\nStanislavski and his Given Circumstances\n\nUnderstanding the world of your character is absolutely vital to creating a believable performance; Stanislavski used this idea to create Given Circumstances. The first step towards doing this is going through the play and writing down all the facts about your character you can find! Example questions you might ask as you go through the script could be: Where Am I? When is it? (The year/the day/time of day etc) Who Am I? (Name/age/your family history/what you do for work etc) What relationships do I have? What has happened before the play started? Once you\u2019ve found out everything you can about your Given Circumstances, you should have lots of material to help you to start understanding your character. They are just as human as you are and need to have as comprehensive a world as you do!\n\nThe Magic If\n\nStanislavski describes The Magic If as being able to imagine a character\u2019s given circumstances enough to understand what that character might do in any situation that arises. So when something happens to your character in the play you can understand how they would respond because you know so much about the world that they exist in.\n\nTasks and Objectives\n\nOnce you have understood the Given Circumstances and mastered the Magic If, Stanislavski encourages the actor to unearth their character\u2019s \u2018tasks\u2019 or \u2018objectives\u2019. Characters always have a number of \u2018tasks\u2019 they wish to solve. To find this out you ask \u2018What Do I Want?\u2019 in each scene and in the play as a whole. For example, in The Lion King, Scar wants to become King, so his task is to kill Mufasa.\n\nBut if Stanislavski was around over a hundred years ago, isn\u2019t it a bit old fashioned? Well, no! Stanislavski\u2019s training technique has been used for a century by actors across the world and still remains thought of as one of the best systems for learning. And it\u2019s a really helpful tool for everyone, no matter what your level or ability.

They are just as human as you are and need to have as comprehensive a world as you do!\n\nThe Magic If\n\nStanislavski describes The Magic If as being able to imagine a character\u2019s given circumstances enough to understand what that character might do in any situation that arises. So when something happens to your character in the play you can understand how they would respond because you know so much about the world that they exist in.\n\nTasks and Objectives\n\nOnce you have understood the Given Circumstances and mastered the Magic If, Stanislavski encourages the actor to unearth their character\u2019s \u2018tasks\u2019 or \u2018objectives\u2019. Characters always have a number of \u2018tasks\u2019 they wish to solve. To find this out you ask \u2018What Do I Want?\u2019 in each scene and in the play as a whole. For example, in The Lion King, Scar wants to become King, so his task is to kill Mufasa.\n\nBut if Stanislavski was around over a hundred years ago, isn\u2019t it a bit old fashioned? Well, no! Stanislavski\u2019s training technique has been used for a century by actors across the world and still remains thought of as one of the best systems for learning. And it\u2019s a really helpful tool for everyone, no matter what your level or ability. If you want to understand the way to create a character and become a more truthful actor, studying Stanislavski is always going to help you unlock those skills and take your training to the next level!", "role": "user"}, {"content": "The Russian actor and director, Konstantin Stanislavski created a system to train actors which uses different techniques that help actors to create believable characters by putting themselves in the character\u2019s place. There are three major parts of this system. Firstly, Given Circumstances means knowing everything about a character found in the script by answering Who, What, Where and When questions. Secondly, the Magic If poses the question to the actor: What would I do if I was in the same circumstances as the character? Finally, Tasks and Objectives asks the actor to define what the character wants and how they will go about getting what they want. Although Stanislavski created his system over 100 years ago, it remains the best technique for actor training.", "role": "assistant"}], "category": "Summarize"}

{"prompt": "Can you explain in short what the article says about how hieroglyphics worked in ancient Egyptian language?\n\n\n1. Hieroglyphics uses pictures, but it isn\u2019t picture writing. Because the symbols used in hieroglyphic writing look like little pictures of people, animals and objects, it\u2019s easy to assume that the hieroglyphs represent those things. Instead, some hieroglyphs signify sounds in the ancient Egyptian language, just as the characters in the Roman alphabet do. Others are ideographic signs, which represent concepts but don\u2019t have a sound attached. 2. Hieroglyphic writing is linked to elite tombs. \"The earliest hieroglyphic writing is commonly found on grave goods found in royal tombs at Abydos that precede the historical period,\" explains Peter F. Dorman, a professor emeritus at the University of Chicago's Oriental Institute. \"Since hieroglyphs are pictorial, the link with early formal art is indelible, especially the representation of the king with his royal titulary, which can be seen on commemorative monuments placed in the earliest temples.\" Though the system was eventually used for other types of writing, hieroglyphs never lost their initial connection with elite contexts in commemorative settings like temples and tombs, Dorman explains. People who weren't royals also sometimes used hieroglyphics in their private tombs and monuments, provided they were wealthy enough to afford the services of stone carvers. 3. Ancient Egyptians used other forms of writing. Because hieroglyphic writing was so complicated, the ancient Egyptians developed other types of writing that were more convenient. Hieratic writing, a cursive script that was written on papyrus with a pen or brush, or upon a piece of limestone called an ostracon was invented for use primarily on papyrus, a more fragile material. But, Dornan says, it rarely made the jump to formal monuments. Demotic, another form of writing that was developed in the 800s B.C., was used for everyday documents, as well as for literary works. 4. Hieroglyphic writing has odd quirks. Hieroglyphic writing doesn't have any spaces between the words, and there's no punctuation. That means that readers have to have a good grasp of ancient Egyptian grammar and know something about the context of a message in order to be able to tell individual words, clauses, sentences, paragraphs and chapters apart.

{"prompt": "Summarize the four different views of Judaism held today based on the information found below.\n\nJudaism today is descended from Rabbinic Judaism, that is, the Judaism that emerged after the destruction of the second temple by the Romans in 70 ce. This form of Judaism was centered around the Torah and the synagogue, instead of the temple. From the first century ce until the nineteenth century, there was basically only one way of being Jewish, and for the most part, by choice or not, it consisted of a life lived separated from the larger society.\nWith the growing secularization in nineteenth-century Western Europe, however, Jews became more active participants in \u201csecular\u201d society, even while maintaining their \u201csacred\u201d practices and beliefs. Different interpretations of Judaism developed that guided the interplay between these sacred and secular worlds. Over time, these differences resulted in the four main branches of Judaism that exist today.\nOrthodox Judaism is the modern term for what historically has been mainline Judaism: in other words, before the nineteenth century, Orthodox Judaism was Judaism, plain and simple. It is based on an understanding of the Torah as the unchangeable, inerrant revelation of God that provides the sole guide for all aspects of one\u2019s daily life. Accordingly, Orthodox Jews meticulously observe Jewish law, that is, halakhah (literally \u201cthe way one walks\u201d), which is based on an understanding that all 613 commandments within the Torah have been revealed as the direct, immutable will of God.\nReform Judaism emerged during the Enlightenment as some sought to \u201creform\u201d Jewish thought and practice in light of new scientific developments, political ideas, and modernism. While Orthodox Judaism considers the Torah the unchanging divine command of God, Reform Judaism sees the Torah as written by \u201cdivinely inspired\u201d human authors. The Torah\u2014and the commandments therein\u2014is regarded as instructional and inspirational, but not absolutely binding. Reform Judaism emphasizes obligation to the neighbor, care for the world, and the injunction to offer hospitality and care to all in need. All other aspects of Judaism are open to negotiation.\nConservative Judaism was founded as a response to what were viewed as overly radical changes in Reform Judaism: it was believed that while change was needed, Reform Judaism had moved too far too quickly. Conservative Judaism emphasizes on ritual practice, rather than specific doctrines. One of the distinguishing marks of Conservative Judaism, as opposed to Reform Judaism, is its preservation of the halakhic process when deciding how traditional interpretation of Jewish law might be changed. In that process, rabbis consult sacred scriptures and commentaries, rabbinic codes of law, and previous generations of rabbinical opinion, in order to craft a new reading for today.\nReconstructionist Judaism is the most recent to emerge. It holds that what is important about Judaism is not that everyone believes the same things about divine revelation, miracles, and God, or that people follow Jewish law in the same way.

But even with all these wonderful benefits, there are some things you should know about this plant before you buy it. If the leaves of your snake plant turn yellow, it might not be a problem immediately, but when you see more yellow leaves, you should try to find out why.\n\nThe snake plant is a houseplant with small clumps of white or cream-colored flowers at the end of long stalks. Let\u2019s find out why snake plant leaves turn yellow and possible solutions.\n\n\nCauses of Snake Plant Leaves Turning Yellow\nThere are a few reasons that snake plant leaves turn yellow. Discussed below are some of the major reasons.\n\n1. Lack of Water\nThe snake plant needs a lot of water to stay green. Therefore, it is essential to see and treat this problem very soon. Water should be provided at least once a week and more often during the summer when the plant is growing faster. Daily watering might not be sufficient at all times.\n\n2. Overwatering\nThe leaves will turn yellow if a snake plant is left in water for too long. This happens because the roots of the plant cannot absorb all the available water and can be soaked up by the soil. Some snake plants are better than others because they don\u2019t seem to mind being watered too much. Others might not be strong enough to handle over-watering, so it\u2019s important to check for this problem often.\n\n3. Lack of Nutrients\nThe snake plant doesn\u2019t need many nutrients to remain healthy, but they do need some. If the plant has been neglected for longer than a week or two, the problem will be more serious and require a solution for more than just water. A nutrient deficiency occurs when you feed the plant too little over time. The leaves will start to have a yellowing problem which will spread over time.\n\n4. Over-fertilization\nOver-fertilization is particularly a problem for people who like to feed their plants but don\u2019t want to buy fertilizer. The difference between fertilizing and over-fertilizing the snake plant is that fertilizers have slightly different ingredients in various mixtures. This can confuse people unfamiliar with the difference and think it\u2019s okay to use certain things like coffee grounds, which are not good for the snake plant. The way you know if you are over-fertilizing is that the plant will get too much water and too many nutrients. The plant will also turn yellow on the leaves, and it might look unhealthy, which is bad.", "prompt_id": "bd435b4af871ca0aaed4338bafb71fd343212b59f6ef73f783e96417161e8557", "messages": [{"content": "Summarize the following text in one paragraph.\n\nHow To Prevent Snake Plant Leaves From Turning Yellow\nThe snake plant is a beautiful plant that is easy to care for, grows in many different environments, and looks good almost anywhere.

{"prompt": "Summarize the main steps of how to grow roses in pots that this article suggests, shortened into 5 steps total, in a list format with a 1-2 sentence explanation each.  \n\nThe source text is as follows:\n\nChoose and Prepare Containers\nChoose a relatively large, tall pot when growing a rose bush. Many experts recommend a pot no less than 15 inches in diameter. Roses send down deep roots, so the taller the container, the better. The soil in pots heats up faster than garden soil, so clay pots are generally better than plastic since clay is slower to transfer heat from the sun into the soil. If you must use plastic pots, use lighter colored plastic, which won't heat up as fast as dark plastic.\n\nMake sure the pots have ample drainage holes in the bottom.\n\nPrepare the Potting Soil\nCreate a potting soil mixture consisting of one-third quality commercial potting soil, one-third garden compost, and one-third composted manure. Add a cup of perlite to enhance drainage. Add 1 cup of bonemeal to the soil mixture. If you wish, you can also add fishmeal or blood meal for added nutrients, but be careful not to over-fertilize, which can burn roots.\n\nPlant the Rose\nFill the pot about two-thirds full of prepared soil mix. If planting a bare root rose, mound the soil up in the center, then place the rose over the mound and spread the roots out over it. If planting a potted rose, just create a slight indentation, then remove the rose from its nursery container and place it into the pot. Loosen the roots if the plant is root bound. Fill in around the rose using the remaining potting soil, pressing it down firmly around the roots. The soil surface should be just slightly beneath the bud union\u2014the point where the rose is grafted to the rootstock.\n\nPlace your potted roses in a location that gets at least seven hours of direct sun each day. On patios and decks, this may mean moving the pots around over the course of the day to keep them in the sun. If you are growing groups of potted roses, keep them spaced at least 2 feet apart to ensure good air circulation.\n\nWater Thoughtfully\nImmediately after planting, water the plant thoroughly so that all the soil is well saturated. After planting, keep an eye on your roses so you know when to water. A good general rule of thumb is to water when the top inch of the soil surface feels dry.\n\nFertilize as Needed\nRepot Every Few Years\nExcept for miniature roses, most roses grown in pots need to be repotted every two or three years, since they are heavy feeders that quickly exhaust potting soils. Using freshly prepared potting soil each time you repot will keep the nutrient levels at an acceptable level. Over time, salts and minerals from fertilizers can also accumulate in the soil.\n\nProtect From Freezing Temperatures\nMulch the base\nBury it\nBuild a cold frame\nBring it inside\n\nAddress Pests and Diseases\nPotted roses are susceptible to many of the same pests and diseases that can plague roses planted in the garden.", "prompt_id": "8c6c6f1fb9d165350b159ab8bf770c6ecacb6aa7bd1c61413cde33ccd8ef11d1", "messages": [{"content": "Summarize the main steps of how to grow roses in pots that this article suggests, shortened into 5 steps total, in a list format with a 1-2 sentence explanation each.  \n\nThe source text is as follows:\n\nChoose and Prepare Containers\nChoose a relatively large, tall pot when growing a rose bush.

{"prompt": "Can you summarize the concept of the Law of Diminishing Marginal Utility in this article section in easy terms?\n\n\nThe law of diminishing marginal utility explains that as a person consumes an item or a product, the satisfaction or utility they derive from the product wanes as they consume more and more of that product. For example, an individual might buy a certain type of chocolate for a while. Soon, they may buy less and choose another type of chocolate or buy cookies instead because the satisfaction they were initially getting from the chocolate is diminishing. Understanding the Law of Diminishing Marginal Utility Whenever an individual interacts or consumes an economic good, that individual acts in a way that demonstrates the order in which they value the use of that good. Thus, the first unit that is consumed satisfies the consumer's greatest need. The second unit results in a lesser amount of satisfaction, and so on. For example, consider an individual on a deserted island who finds a case of bottled water that washes ashore. That person might drink the first bottle indicating that satisfying their thirst was the most important use of the water. The individual might bathe themselves with the second bottle, or they might decide to save it for later. If they save it for later, this indicates that the person values the future use of the water more than bathing today, but still less than the immediate quenching of their thirst. This is called ordinal time preference. This concept helps explain savings and investing versus current consumption and spending. The example above also helps to explain why demand curves are downward sloping in microeconomic models since each additional unit of a good or service is put toward a less valuable use.", "prompt_id": "1035de8e979f8638a58d7ffaa8f99ecb0781c137fe9e5f671cfdc8830e92a6b6", "messages": [{"content": "Can you summarize the concept of the Law of Diminishing Marginal Utility in this article section in easy terms?\n\n\nThe law of diminishing marginal utility explains that as a person consumes an item or a product, the satisfaction or utility they derive from the product wanes as they consume more and more of that product.

{"prompt": "Can you summarize the three methods of capturing carbon dioxide discussed in the article?\n\n\nUse the following article:\n\nHow can we capture carbon? There are essentially three ways to capture the carbon dioxide from a power plant: before the fuel is burned (precombustion), after the fuel is burned (postcombustion), or by burning the fuel in more oxygen and storing all the gases produced as a result (oxyfuel). Precombustion In precombustion, the aim is to remove the carbon from coal fuel before it's burned. The coal is reacted with oxygen (O2) to make syngas (synthesis gas), a mixture of carbon (CO) monoxide and hydrogen (H2) gases. The hydrogen can be removed and either burned directly as fuel or compressed and stored for use in fuel-cell cars. Water is added to the carbon monoxide to make carbon dioxide (which is stored) and additional hydrogen, which is added to the hydrogen previously removed. Postcombustion In postcombustion, we're trying to remove carbon dioxide from a power station's output after a fuel has been burned. That means waste gases have to be captured and scrubbed clean of their CO2 before they travel up smokestacks. The scrubbing is done by passing the gases through ammonia, which is then blasted clean with steam, releasing the CO2 for storage. Oxyfuel (oxycombustion) CCS would be much easier if power plants produced pure CO2 as their smokestack waste. Then, instead of laboriously separating out the CO2 from other waste gases, we could trap the entire output from the smokestacks and store the lot. The trouble is that power plants don't produce pure CO2 because there's often not enough oxygen for complete combustion they produce other pollutant gases as well. One way to purify the exhaust is to blow extra oxygen into the furnace so the fuel burns completely producing relatively pure steam and CO2.

Precombustion In precombustion, the aim is to remove the carbon from coal fuel before it's burned. The coal is reacted with oxygen (O2) to make syngas (synthesis gas), a mixture of carbon (CO) monoxide and hydrogen (H2) gases. The hydrogen can be removed and either burned directly as fuel or compressed and stored for use in fuel-cell cars. Water is added to the carbon monoxide to make carbon dioxide (which is stored) and additional hydrogen, which is added to the hydrogen previously removed. Postcombustion In postcombustion, we're trying to remove carbon dioxide from a power station's output after a fuel has been burned. That means waste gases have to be captured and scrubbed clean of their CO2 before they travel up smokestacks. The scrubbing is done by passing the gases through ammonia, which is then blasted clean with steam, releasing the CO2 for storage. Oxyfuel (oxycombustion) CCS would be much easier if power plants produced pure CO2 as their smokestack waste. Then, instead of laboriously separating out the CO2 from other waste gases, we could trap the entire output from the smokestacks and store the lot. The trouble is that power plants don't produce pure CO2 because there's often not enough oxygen for complete combustion they produce other pollutant gases as well. One way to purify the exhaust is to blow extra oxygen into the furnace so the fuel burns completely producing relatively pure steam and CO2. Once the steam is removed (by cooling and condensing it to make water), the CO2 can be stored.", "role": "user"}, {"content": "The article explores precombustion, post-combustion, and oxyfuel as methods for capturing CO2 emissions from power plants. Precombustion entails eliminating carbon before burning fuel, post-combustion entails trapping CO2 emissions after the fuel is burned, and oxyfuel involves using oxygen to burn fuel and produce CO2 for storage purposes.", "role": "assistant"}], "category": "Summarize"}

When asked to say a few words about the award, he said, \u201cLaw reform is tremendously exciting and I am truly thankful to have been given the opportunity to work with and learn from some of the country\u2019s most informed and forward legal minds.\u201d[2] In 2010, Tan was appointed as the inaugural Geoffrey Bartholomew Professor.[3] On his appointment, NUS Law Dean Tan Cheng Han noted, \"It is befitting that the inaugural appointee is Professor Tan Yock Lin. Besides sharing a deep practice in the law, both Professor Tan and Professor Bartholomew started out as economists. Though their paths may not quite have crossed, each has left indelible footprints for the rest of us to follow. Just as Professor Bartholomew had touched many lives in his time at the University, Prof Tan continues to share his wealth of experience and knowledge with many of our law students.\"[3] The professorship title was succeeded by Jeffrey Pinsler.[4] In 2021, he was appointed an Emeritus Professor at NUS.[5] He received the Long Service Medal in 2013.[6]", "role": "user"}, {"content": "Tan Yock Lin is a distinguished law professor at the National University of Singapore, and he specializes in criminal procedure, conflicts of law, and the legal profession.

Ethanol is a type of fuel made from corn that can be burned in a regular combustion engine without producing the harmful pollution that gasoline is known for.

At a conference on international sport held in Paris in 1894, Coubertin managed to convince delegates from 49 organizations representing nine countries to vote in favor of an Olympic revival. His chief allies in this effort were Dimitrios Vikelas of Greece and Professor William M. Sloane of the United States.\n\nThe organizers had planned the first modern Olympics for 1900 in Paris, but later decided to move the date forward to 1896 and to change the venue to Athens, though the local government of the Greek capital was initially hostile to the idea. Coubertin and his colleagues of the newly formed International Olympic Committee (IOC) eventually prevailed, and the first Olympic Games of the modern era were inaugurated by the King of Greece in the first week of April 1896.\n\nThe games of 1896, 1900 and 1904 were loosely organized and did not feature national teams produced by rigorous selection.

{"prompt": "Can you summarize the benefits of time tracking mentioned in the article?\n\nWhat I\u2019ve Learned So Far A few early observations: 1. Time tracking takes time! But mostly it takes mindfulness. Learning to monitor what you\u2019re doing every 15 minutes takes some getting used to. I often find myself looking up and suddenly realizing I\u2019m not sure what I\u2019ve done for the last 40 minutes, sometimes longer\u2014which of course is notable in itself. On the positive side, I like seeing the columns fill up. I can tell there are patterns to be deciphered and improved upon. *There\u2019s an option to track your time every half-hour if fifteen-minute intervals feels excessive, but so far I\u2019m thinking I\u2019ll stick with fifteen. 2. The mere act of tracking my time helps me be more intentional. When I know I have to account for my time, even if only to myself, I find myself making wiser decisions. I plan my days more carefully. I started writing this post a few days ago, but I\u2019m finishing it while waiting for a replacement driver\u2019s license at the DMV. It\u2019s not unusual for me to productively use waiting time. I think what\u2019s different is that today I made this my default state instead of just looking at my phone or zoning out. I knew I\u2019d need to account for what became a 30-minute wait, so I made sure to use it well. 3. Momentum matters. Week I of tracking my time flew by and I only got behind a couple of afternoons. With a trip to New York City and a few other things that threw off my schedule in Week II, I got much more behind. There\u2019s definitely a sense of momentum or inertia to this process: stay on track and you\u2019ll want to keep it going, lose a few hours and you\u2019ll feel discouraged. Laura notes that most people have irregular weeks, but you shouldn\u2019t wait for a \u201cregular\u201d week to start tracking. Disruptions happen in every week. I always have different projects to work on and I typically travel every week, so if I waited for a \u201cnormal\u201d week at home I\u2019d be waiting a long time. If I continue this discipline beyond another couple of weeks, I\u2019ll need to make sure I integrate it into my traveling life. 4. I don\u2019t feel guilty about intentional time that isn\u2019t spent productively. I don\u2019t really have hobbies (I\u2019ve tried!) and I sometimes say that relaxing stresses me out. There are a lot of intervals I filled up with items \u201creading,\u201d \u201cwalking to gym,\u201d \u201cphone call with a friend,\u201d or even \u201csearch for mistake fares for post-WDS Asia trip.\u201d And I liked that! I don\u2019t feel that these things detract from my other goals at all. I don\u2019t want to avoid or minimize them; in some ways I\u2019d like to do more of them. What I want to avoid is wasted time. Almost every day I have numerous 15-minute intervals that I don\u2019t know what to label because I don\u2019t remember what I did. This, at least for me, means that I frittered away the time without doing anything productive or taking time for myself in an intentional way.", "prompt_id": "b08c932b530adc87bb42622eb35f8cc95e5307572552efbeeb8239e222b7d02b", "messages": [{"content": "Can you summarize the benefits of time tracking mentioned in the article?\n\nWhat I\u2019ve Learned So Far A few early observations: 1.

On the positive side, I like seeing the columns fill up. I can tell there are patterns to be deciphered and improved upon. *There\u2019s an option to track your time every half-hour if fifteen-minute intervals feels excessive, but so far I\u2019m thinking I\u2019ll stick with fifteen. 2. The mere act of tracking my time helps me be more intentional. When I know I have to account for my time, even if only to myself, I find myself making wiser decisions. I plan my days more carefully. I started writing this post a few days ago, but I\u2019m finishing it while waiting for a replacement driver\u2019s license at the DMV. It\u2019s not unusual for me to productively use waiting time. I think what\u2019s different is that today I made this my default state instead of just looking at my phone or zoning out. I knew I\u2019d need to account for what became a 30-minute wait, so I made sure to use it well. 3. Momentum matters. Week I of tracking my time flew by and I only got behind a couple of afternoons. With a trip to New York City and a few other things that threw off my schedule in Week II, I got much more behind. There\u2019s definitely a sense of momentum or inertia to this process: stay on track and you\u2019ll want to keep it going, lose a few hours and you\u2019ll feel discouraged. Laura notes that most people have irregular weeks, but you shouldn\u2019t wait for a \u201cregular\u201d week to start tracking. Disruptions happen in every week. I always have different projects to work on and I typically travel every week, so if I waited for a \u201cnormal\u201d week at home I\u2019d be waiting a long time. If I continue this discipline beyond another couple of weeks, I\u2019ll need to make sure I integrate it into my traveling life. 4. I don\u2019t feel guilty about intentional time that isn\u2019t spent productively. I don\u2019t really have hobbies (I\u2019ve tried!) and I sometimes say that relaxing stresses me out. There are a lot of intervals I filled up with items \u201creading,\u201d \u201cwalking to gym,\u201d \u201cphone call with a friend,\u201d or even \u201csearch for mistake fares for post-WDS Asia trip.\u201d And I liked that! I don\u2019t feel that these things detract from my other goals at all. I don\u2019t want to avoid or minimize them; in some ways I\u2019d like to do more of them. What I want to avoid is wasted time. Almost every day I have numerous 15-minute intervals that I don\u2019t know what to label because I don\u2019t remember what I did. This, at least for me, means that I frittered away the time without doing anything productive or taking time for myself in an intentional way.", "role": "user"}, {"content": "Time tracking allows you to be more mindful, intentional, and productive. It helps maintain momentum and avoid wasted time while also allowing for intentional leisure time.

{"prompt": "Create a one-sentence summary of To Kill a Mockingbird based on the article below.\n\nTo Kill a Mockingbird is primarily a novel about growing up under extraordinary circumstances in the 1930s in the Southern United States. The story covers a span of three years, during which the main characters undergo significant changes. Scout Finch lives with her brother Jem and their father Atticus in the fictitious town of Maycomb, Alabama. Maycomb is a small, close-knit town, and every family has its social station depending on where they live, who their parents are, and how long their ancestors have lived in Maycomb.\n\nA widower, Atticus raises his children by himself, with the help of kindly neighbors and a black housekeeper named Calpurnia. Scout and Jem almost instinctively understand the complexities and machinations of their neighborhood and town. The only neighbor who puzzles them is the mysterious Arthur Radley, nicknamed Boo, who never comes outside. When Dill, another neighbor's nephew, starts spending summers in Maycomb, the three children begin an obsessive \u2014 and sometimes perilous \u2014 quest to lure Boo outside.\n\nScout is a tomboy who prefers the company of boys and generally solves her differences with her fists. She tries to make sense of a world that demands that she act like a lady, a brother who criticizes her for acting like a girl, and a father who accepts her just as she is. Scout hates school, gaining her most valuable education on her own street and from her father.\n\nNot quite midway through the story, Scout and Jem discover that their father is going to represent a black man named Tom Robinson, who is accused of raping and beating a white woman. Suddenly, Scout and Jem have to tolerate a barrage of racial slurs and insults because of Atticus' role in the trial. During this time, Scout has a very difficult time restraining from physically fighting with other children, a tendency that gets her in trouble with her Aunt Alexandra and Uncle Jack. Even Jem, the older and more levelheaded of the two, loses his temper a time or two. After responding to a neighbor's (Mrs. Dubose) verbal attack by destroying her plants, Jem is sentenced to read to her every day after school for one month. Ultimately, Scout and Jem learn a powerful lesson about bravery from this woman. As the trial draws nearer, Aunt Alexandra comes to live with them under the guise of providing a feminine influence for Scout.\n\nDuring the novel's last summer, Tom is tried and convicted even though Atticus proves that Tom could not have possibly committed the crime of which he is accused. In the process of presenting Tom's case, Atticus inadvertently insults and offends Bob Ewell, a nasty, lazy drunkard whose daughter is Tom's accuser. In spite of Tom's conviction, Ewell vows revenge on Atticus and the judge for besmirching his already tarnished name. All three children are bewildered by the jury's decision to convict; Atticus tries to explain why the jury's decision was in many ways a foregone conclusion.\n\nShortly after the trial, Scout attends one of her aunt's Missionary Society meetings. Atticus interrupts the meeting to report that Tom Robinson had been killed in an escape attempt. Scout learns valuable lessons about achieving the ideal of womanhood and carrying on in the face of adversity that day.\n\nThings slowly return to normal in Maycomb, and Scout and Jem realize that Boo Radley is no longer an all-consuming curiosity. The story appears to be winding down, but then Bob Ewell starts making good on his threats of revenge. Scout is in the Halloween pageant at school, playing the part of a ham. With Atticus and Aunt Alexandra both too tired to attend, Jem agrees to take Scout to the school. After embarrassing herself on-stage, Scout elects to leave her ham costume on for the walk home with Jem.\n\nOn the way home, the children hear odd noises, but convince themselves that the noises are coming from another friend who scared them on their way to school that evening. Suddenly, a scuffle occurs. Scout really can't see outside of her costume, but she hears Jem being pushed away, and she feels powerful arms squeezing her costume's chicken wire against her skin. During this attack, Jem badly breaks his arm. Scout gets just enough of a glimpse out of her costume to see a stranger carrying Jem back to their house.\n\nThe sheriff arrives at the Finch house to announce that Bob Ewell has been found dead under the tree where the children were attacked, having fallen on his own knife. By this time, Scout realizes that the stranger is none other than Boo Radley, and that Boo is actually responsible for killing Ewell, thus saving her and Jem's lives. In spite of Atticus' insistence to the contrary, the sheriff refuses to press charges against Boo. Scout agrees with this decision and explains her understanding to her father. Boo sees Jem one more time and then asks Scout to take him home, but rather than escort him home as though he were a child, she has Boo escort her to his house as a gentleman would.\n\nWith Boo safely home, Scout returns to Jem's room where Atticus is waiting.

{"prompt": "Can you summarize the Scarcity Principle in economics from this article?\n\nWhat is the Scarcity Principle? The scarcity principle is a theory in economics that maintains that scarcity in the supply of a product and high demand for that product cause a discrepancy in the supply and demand equilibrium. According to this principle, a scarce or rare goods often has a higher value and this results in a mismatch between demand and supply. In order to reach an equilibrium between supply and demand, the scarcity principle offers that the price of a rare product be increased until the equilibrium is reached. Hence, only individual with higher purchase power will be able to afford a scarce commodity, denying others the chance to obtain the product. How does the Scarcity Principle Work? Oftentimes, market equilibrium is distorted as a result of a mismatch in the level of supply and demand. For instance, when there is more demand for a product than the number that is supplied, equilibrium cannot be reached. When there is a higher demand for a product, it means the product is scarce, for equilibrium to be reached, the scarcity principle suggests that the price of the scarce good be increased so that the levels of supply and demand will match. According to the scarcity principle, a scarce or rare product has a higher value than other normal products.

The thing that stops Sonic in his tracks is the sudden, distressing realization that he is utterly, hopelessly and painfully alone.\n\nAgainst all preconceptions, \u201cSonic the Hedgehog\u201d is a sharp and very human tale about loneliness, and the limits of what you can accomplish alone. Sonic is from another planet, and he\u2019s lived, in hiding, in a Montana suburb for 10 years. His joy is sustained through comic books and toys, but he longs for friendship.\n\nEnter Tom Wachowski (James Marsden), the sheriff of idyllic Montana suburb Green Hill. Green Hill is a sleepy hamlet, and Wachowski wants nothing more than to hit that thunder road and become a top cop in San Francisco.\n\nSonic knows of Wachowski, but Green Hill\u2019s top cop is oblivious of Sonic until circumstances bring the U.S. military and its top drone developer, Dr. Robotnik (Jim Carrey) to find Sonic and dissect him for science experiments. The plot eventually develops into a road trip movie as the protagonists travel from Montana to San Francisco.\n\nThe movie\u2019s tone, humor and quick wit will feel familiar for fans of Edgar Wright, director of \u201cHot Fuzz,\u201d \u201cShaun of the Dead\u201d and several other witty buddy comedies. Kids will be absolutely delighted. But older viewers (such as 38-year-old adults, like myself) will also find something here: The film respects its audience\u2019s intelligence.", "role": "user"}, {"content": "Although the character Sonic is a superspeed-wielding alien hedgehog, the film tells a very human story about loneliness.

In the end, no one was convicted of charges for the deaths, injuries or property damage.[121]\n\nOn June 3, a group of over 1,000 businessmen and civic leaders met, resolving to form a committee to raise funds and aid in rebuilding Greenwood. Judge J. Martin, a former mayor of Tulsa, was chosen as the chairman of the group.

Charles Page was commended for his philanthropic efforts in the wake of the riot in the assistance of 'destitute blacks'.[122]\n\nA group of influential white developers persuaded the city to pass a fire ordinance that would have prohibited many black people from rebuilding in Greenwood. Their intention was to redevelop Greenwood for more business and industrial use and force black people further to the edge of the city for residences. The case was litigated and appealed to the Oklahoma Supreme Court by Buck Colbert Franklin, where the ordinance was ruled unconstitutional.

That\u2019s why each year on April 22, more than a billion people celebrate Earth Day to protect the planet from things like pollution and deforestation. By taking part in activities like picking up litter and planting trees, we\u2019re making our world a happier, healthier place to live.\nThe first Earth Day was celebrated in 1970, when a United States senator from Wisconsin organized a national demonstration to raise awareness about environmental issues. Rallies took place across the country and, by the end of the year, the U.S. government had created the Environmental Protection Agency. By 1990, Earth Day was an event celebrated by more than 140 countries around the globe.\n\nYou can celebrate and protect the planet at the same time. Check out these Earth Day ideas to help save the planet any time of year.\n\nBECOME A WASTE WARRIOR\n The number of garbage trucks Americans fill each year would stretch halfway to the moon. Toilet paper tubes, made from cardboard, take two months to decompose in a landfill. A plastic bottle sticks around for way longer\u2014it can take over 450 years to break down! But instead of turning to the trash bin, you could turn these items into an awesome telescope or a flower planter. Before you throw something away, think about whether it can be recycled or repurposed. You can also limit waste by reducing the amount of things you buy. For example, check the library for that book you have to read before visiting the store.\n\nPLANT A TREE\nResearchers estimate roughly 15 billion trees in the world are cut down each year, so help offset that loss by planting a tree of your own. Trees absorb carbon dioxide and release oxygen for people to breathe. They also provide shelter and food for animals such as squirrels and owls. Depending on where trees are planted, their shade can even reduce the need for air-conditioning in hotter months. How many more reasons do you need to go green?\n\nTURN OFF THE LIGHTS\nDoes that lamp really need to be on while the sun is out? Electricity doesn\u2019t just happen\u2014it has to be produced from things around us. A lot of times it comes from fossil fuels (such as coal, oil, or natural gas) that contribute to climate change. But electricity can also be made from renewable sources like wind, water, the sun, and even elephant dung! No matter where it\u2019s coming from, try conserving electrical energy by using only what you need.\n\nLIMIT YOUR WATER USAGE\nTurning off the faucet when you brush your teeth can conserve up to eight gallons of water a day.\nIt might seem like it\u2019s everywhere, but clean, drinkable water is a limited resource. In fact less than one percent of the water on Earth can be used by humans. (The rest is either too salty or too difficult to access.) Turning off the faucet when you brush your teeth can conserve up to eight gallons of water a day. To help save even more water, challenge yourself to take a shorter shower (but still get clean!).\n\nOFFER YOUR TIME\nWith a parent\u2019s permission, volunteer to pick up trash at a nearby park, start a collection drive for recyclable items, or organize a screening of an environmentally themed movie. By getting involved and working with others, you\u2019re not just helping the Earth\u2014you\u2019re making new friends too!\n\nSPREAD THE MESSAGE\nTalk to your friends and family members about what you\u2019re doing and ask them to help.

Electricity doesn\u2019t just happen\u2014it has to be produced from things around us. A lot of times it comes from fossil fuels (such as coal, oil, or natural gas) that contribute to climate change. But electricity can also be made from renewable sources like wind, water, the sun, and even elephant dung! No matter where it\u2019s coming from, try conserving electrical energy by using only what you need.\n\nLIMIT YOUR WATER USAGE\nTurning off the faucet when you brush your teeth can conserve up to eight gallons of water a day.\nIt might seem like it\u2019s everywhere, but clean, drinkable water is a limited resource. In fact less than one percent of the water on Earth can be used by humans. (The rest is either too salty or too difficult to access.) Turning off the faucet when you brush your teeth can conserve up to eight gallons of water a day. To help save even more water, challenge yourself to take a shorter shower (but still get clean!).\n\nOFFER YOUR TIME\nWith a parent\u2019s permission, volunteer to pick up trash at a nearby park, start a collection drive for recyclable items, or organize a screening of an environmentally themed movie. By getting involved and working with others, you\u2019re not just helping the Earth\u2014you\u2019re making new friends too!\n\nSPREAD THE MESSAGE\nTalk to your friends and family members about what you\u2019re doing and ask them to help. Need to get the conversation started? Get everyone together and reconnect with nature by taking one of our Get Outside challenges, or check out some other green tips you can share.

{"prompt": "Please summarize the main points of the text about Axon's independent AI ethics board and the challenges of balancing business objectives with responsible digital practices.\n\nIn 2018, Rick Smith, founder and CEO of Axon, the Scottsdale, Arizona-based manufacturer of Taser weapons and body cameras, became concerned that advances in technology were creating new and challenging ethical issues. So, he set up an independent AI ethics board made up of ethicists, AI experts, public policy specialists, and representatives of law enforcement to provide recommendations to Axon\u2019s management. In 2019, the board recommended against adding facial recognition technology to the company\u2019s line of body cameras, and in 2020, it provided guidelines regarding the use of automated license plate recognition technology. Axon\u2019s management followed both recommendations.\n\nIn 2022, the board recommended against a management proposal to produce a drone-mounted Taser designed to address mass shootings. After initially accepting the board\u2019s recommendation, the company changed its mind and, in June 2022, in the wake of the Uvalde school shootings, announced it was launching the taser drone program anyway. The board\u2019s response was dramatic: Nine of the 13 members resigned, and they released a letter that outlined their concerns. In response, the company announced a freeze on the project.\n\nAs societal expectations grow for the responsible use of digital technologies, firms that promote better practices will have a distinct advantage. According to a 2022 study, 58% of consumers, 60% of employees, and 64% of investors make key decisions based on their beliefs and values. Strengthening your organization\u2019s digital responsibility can drive value creation, and brands regarded as more responsible will enjoy higher levels of stakeholder trust and loyalty. These businesses will sell more products and services, find it easier to recruit staff, and enjoy fruitful relationships with shareholders.\n\nHowever, many organizations struggle to balance the legitimate but competing stakeholder interests. Key tensions arise between business objectives and responsible digital practices. For example, data localization requirements often contradict with the efficiency ambitions of globally distributed value chains. Ethical and responsible checks and balances that need to be introduced during AI/algorithm development tend to slow down development speed, which can be a problem when time-to-market is of utmost importance. Better data and analytics may enhance service personalization, but at the cost of customer privacy. Risks related to transparency and discrimination issues may dissuade organizations from using algorithms that could help drive cost reductions.\n", "prompt_id": "bfb7b905dd9d9bf51db475399d28629503a1f81d8a50f044654473cabf4b2535", "messages": [{"content": "Please summarize the main points of the text about Axon's independent AI ethics board and the challenges of balancing business objectives with responsible digital practices.\n\nIn 2018, Rick Smith, founder and CEO of Axon, the Scottsdale, Arizona-based manufacturer of Taser weapons and body cameras, became concerned that advances in technology were creating new and challenging ethical issues.

In response, the company announced a freeze on the project.\n\nAs societal expectations grow for the responsible use of digital technologies, firms that promote better practices will have a distinct advantage. According to a 2022 study, 58% of consumers, 60% of employees, and 64% of investors make key decisions based on their beliefs and values. Strengthening your organization\u2019s digital responsibility can drive value creation, and brands regarded as more responsible will enjoy higher levels of stakeholder trust and loyalty. These businesses will sell more products and services, find it easier to recruit staff, and enjoy fruitful relationships with shareholders.\n\nHowever, many organizations struggle to balance the legitimate but competing stakeholder interests. Key tensions arise between business objectives and responsible digital practices. For example, data localization requirements often contradict with the efficiency ambitions of globally distributed value chains. Ethical and responsible checks and balances that need to be introduced during AI/algorithm development tend to slow down development speed, which can be a problem when time-to-market is of utmost importance. Better data and analytics may enhance service personalization, but at the cost of customer privacy. Risks related to transparency and discrimination issues may dissuade organizations from using algorithms that could help drive cost reductions.\n", "role": "user"}, {"content": "The text talks about Axon's AI ethics board, which was established by the CEO to address ethical concerns arising from rapidly developing technology.

{"prompt": "Can you please summarize the aspects and workings of big data mentioned in the article in a few lines?\n\nUse information only from the following part of the article:\n\nWhat Is Big Data? \nBig data refers to the large, diverse sets of information that grow at ever-increasing rates. It encompasses the volume of information, the velocity or speed at which it is created and collected, and the variety or scope of the data points being covered (known as the \"three v's\" of big data). Big data often comes from data mining and arrives in multiple formats. \n\nHow Big Data Works \nBig data can be categorized as unstructured or structured. Structured data consists of information already managed by the organization in databases and spreadsheets; it is frequently numeric in nature. Unstructured data is information that is unorganized and does not fall into a predetermined model or format. It includes data gathered from social media sources, which help institutions gather information on customer needs. Big data can be collected from publicly shared comments on social networks and websites, voluntarily gathered from personal electronics and apps, through questionnaires, product purchases, and electronic check-ins.

It encompasses the volume of information, the velocity or speed at which it is created and collected, and the variety or scope of the data points being covered (known as the \"three v's\" of big data). Big data often comes from data mining and arrives in multiple formats. \n\nHow Big Data Works \nBig data can be categorized as unstructured or structured. Structured data consists of information already managed by the organization in databases and spreadsheets; it is frequently numeric in nature. Unstructured data is information that is unorganized and does not fall into a predetermined model or format. It includes data gathered from social media sources, which help institutions gather information on customer needs. Big data can be collected from publicly shared comments on social networks and websites, voluntarily gathered from personal electronics and apps, through questionnaires, product purchases, and electronic check-ins.

{"prompt": "In a short paragraph summarize journalist Peter Bradshaw's 2017 opinion of the second Guardians of the Galaxy movie.\n\nGuardians of the Galaxy Vol 2 review \u2013 funny sequel suffers from pinballing pointlessness\n\nThe Marvel superhero gang are back together \u2013 including Vin Diesel\u2019s Baby Groot alongside Chris Pratt\u2019s Quill \u2013 and while there\u2019s plenty of comedy, it doesn\u2019t really go anywhere\n\nPeter Bradshaw\nMon 24 Apr 2017\n\nMarvel\u2019s likeable superhero comedy Guardians of the Galaxy is back for amiable and goofy volume number two, and its beefy-yet-quirky space hero and team leader Peter Quill, played by Chris Pratt, duly has a second volume of that Awesome Mixtape on the Sony Walkman he has on him at all times.\n\nIt\u2019s the same combination of cartoony action and intergalactic screwball with some ambient production design recalling the photorealist sci-fi imagery of Roger Dean or Chris Foss in a bygone age, creating a visual sense of earnestness to offset the archly retro pop culture gags. Again, it has its own supercharged Heart FM playlist of 70s and 80s music. The early 70s track Brandy (You\u2019re a Fine Girl) by Looking Glass is laid on the soundtrack almost ecstatically in the opening sequence, and some tongue-in-cheek dialogue later invokes it as the greatest piece of music ever to have emerged from Planet Earth. This film rattles along and there\u2019s a lot to enjoy, but there\u2019s a weird air of pointlessness, almost plotlessness to this sequel.\n\nGuardians of the Galaxy Vol 2 trailer starring Baby Groot Guardian\nThe old gang are still together: as well as Quill, there is the green-faced Gamora, played by Zoe Saldana, and the mighty, slab-like Drax, played by Dave Bautista. Vin Diesel provides the voice of Baby Groot, and Bradley Cooper voices the foxy, weaselly figure of Rocket; he is the louche and disreputable character whose job is to get the group into trouble. The Guardians get into some serious trouble pinching some energy sources from a certain golden empress named Ayesha, very amusingly played by Elizabeth Debicki.

Again, it has its own supercharged Heart FM playlist of 70s and 80s music. The early 70s track Brandy (You\u2019re a Fine Girl) by Looking Glass is laid on the soundtrack almost ecstatically in the opening sequence, and some tongue-in-cheek dialogue later invokes it as the greatest piece of music ever to have emerged from Planet Earth. This film rattles along and there\u2019s a lot to enjoy, but there\u2019s a weird air of pointlessness, almost plotlessness to this sequel.\n\nGuardians of the Galaxy Vol 2 trailer starring Baby Groot Guardian\nThe old gang are still together: as well as Quill, there is the green-faced Gamora, played by Zoe Saldana, and the mighty, slab-like Drax, played by Dave Bautista. Vin Diesel provides the voice of Baby Groot, and Bradley Cooper voices the foxy, weaselly figure of Rocket; he is the louche and disreputable character whose job is to get the group into trouble. The Guardians get into some serious trouble pinching some energy sources from a certain golden empress named Ayesha, very amusingly played by Elizabeth Debicki. She has a haughty, queenly manner and an air of frozen displeasure whenever one of her many courtiers make a mess of things: Debicki\u2019s Ayesha would be a great returning character, and on the strength of this Debicki would be strong casting in any new film about Elizabeth I, stealing Cate Blanchett\u2019s crown.\n\nThe ensuing cosmic affray brings Quill and the Guardians back into contact with Yondu (Michael Rooker), the hated freebooter who kidnapped Quill from Planet Earth when he was a child, and with Gamora\u2019s fanatically driven and malevolent sister, Nebula, played by Karen Gillan.

Jews refer to the Maccabees, but the family is more commonly known as the Hasmoneans.\nLike other rulers before him, Antiochus underestimated the will and strength of his Jewish adversaries and sent a small force to put down the rebellion.

By this time Antiochus had died and his successor agreed to the Jews' demand for independence. In the year 142 BCE, after more than 500 years of subjugation, the Jews were again masters of their own fate.\nWhen Mattathias died, the revolt was led by his son Judas, or Judah Maccabee, as he is often called.

{"prompt": "Tell me about crizotinib.\n\nAbstract\nAnaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene rearrangements are present in a small subset of non-small-cell lung cancers. ALK-positivity confers sensitivity to small-molecule ALK kinase inhibitors, such as crizotinib. The integration of crizotinib into standard treatment practice in NSCLC will rest on the widespread implementation of an effective screening system for newly diagnosed patients with NSCLC which is flexible enough to incorporate new targets as treatments are developed for them. Phase I and II studies of crizotinib in ALK-positive lung cancer have demonstrated significant activity and impressive clinical benefit, which led to its early approval by USFDA in 2011. Although crizotinib induces remissions and extends the lives of patients, there have been reports of emerging resistance to Crizotinib therapy. In this review, we discuss the history, mechanism of action, uses, adverse effects, dose modifications and future challenges and opportunities for patients with ALK-positive lung cancers.\n\nKeywords: ALK mutation, ALK inhibitors, ALK positive Non-small cell lung cancer, Crizotinib\n\nOverview of Clinical Trials\nThe antitumor efficacy of crizotinib was initially demonstrated in two multicenter, single-arm studies.[23,24] Dosage for these extended series was 250 mg, orally, given twice a day, based on results from the initial phase I dose escalation study. In aggregate, these studies included 255 patients, all of whose tumors contained an ALK gene rearrangement, as shown by FISH. Overall, 95% of the patients had metastatic disease and 5% had locally advanced NSCLC. Overall, 94% of the patients had received prior systemic therapy for advanced or metastatic disease, and 76% had received two or more treatment regimens. The combined objective (complete plus partial) response rate was 55%, the majority of which was achieved during the first eight weeks of treatment. The median durations of response at the time of analysis of the two studies were 42 and 48 weeks, respectively [Table 1].\n\nTable 1\nComparison of results of profile 1001 and profile 1005 trials\n\nAn external file that holds a picture, illustration, etc.\nObject name is SAJC-2-91-g003.jpg\nEvidence of the impact of crizotinib on the survival of patients came from a non-randomized, retrospective analysis of the patients enrolled in the phase I study.[25] The one- and two-year survival rates for patients treated with crizotinib were 74 and 54%, respectively, with a median follow-up of 18 months. In a cohort of 36 patients with the ALK fusion oncogene, who were not treated with crizotinib, the survival rates at one- and two-years were 44 and 12%, respectively. A comparison with a larger cohort of patients with wild-type tumors did not identify a difference when compared with those with the ALK rearrangement not treated with crizotinib, suggesting that the presence of ALK rearrangement was not prognostically significant.\n\nConclusions\nThe presence of an ALK fusion oncogene defines a molecular subset of NSCLC with distinct clinical and pathological features. The patients most likely to harbor ALK rearrangement are relatively young, never or light smokers with adenocarcinoma. Whenever possible, therapy of patients with advanced NSCLC should be individualized, based on the molecular and histological features of the tumor. If feasible, patients should have the tumor tissue assessed for the presence of a somatic mutation in the EGFR, which confers sensitivity to the EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors and to the ALK fusion oncogene, which is associated with sensitivity to crizotinib.\n\nThus, crizotinib is an important unmet medical need. It is a straightforward, biology-based biomarker, predicting a high response rate in heavily pre-treated patients and is relatively non-toxic. It is a triumph for a targeted therapy in the era of oncogenic driver mutations.", "prompt_id": "3fb647de70bb1ed4604f126fd7a5d729b29fdf1cec889604d4ef2e2565bc24b6", "messages": [{"content": "Tell me about crizotinib.\n\nAbstract\nAnaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene rearrangements are present in a small subset of non-small-cell lung cancers.

The median durations of response at the time of analysis of the two studies were 42 and 48 weeks, respectively [Table 1].\n\nTable 1\nComparison of results of profile 1001 and profile 1005 trials\n\nAn external file that holds a picture, illustration, etc.\nObject name is SAJC-2-91-g003.jpg\nEvidence of the impact of crizotinib on the survival of patients came from a non-randomized, retrospective analysis of the patients enrolled in the phase I study.[25] The one- and two-year survival rates for patients treated with crizotinib were 74 and 54%, respectively, with a median follow-up of 18 months. In a cohort of 36 patients with the ALK fusion oncogene, who were not treated with crizotinib, the survival rates at one- and two-years were 44 and 12%, respectively. A comparison with a larger cohort of patients with wild-type tumors did not identify a difference when compared with those with the ALK rearrangement not treated with crizotinib, suggesting that the presence of ALK rearrangement was not prognostically significant.\n\nConclusions\nThe presence of an ALK fusion oncogene defines a molecular subset of NSCLC with distinct clinical and pathological features. The patients most likely to harbor ALK rearrangement are relatively young, never or light smokers with adenocarcinoma. Whenever possible, therapy of patients with advanced NSCLC should be individualized, based on the molecular and histological features of the tumor. If feasible, patients should have the tumor tissue assessed for the presence of a somatic mutation in the EGFR, which confers sensitivity to the EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors and to the ALK fusion oncogene, which is associated with sensitivity to crizotinib.\n\nThus, crizotinib is an important unmet medical need. It is a straightforward, biology-based biomarker, predicting a high response rate in heavily pre-treated patients and is relatively non-toxic. It is a triumph for a targeted therapy in the era of oncogenic driver mutations.", "role": "user"}, {"content": "Crizotinib is a small-molecule anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) inhibitor that can be used to induce remission in non-small-cell lung cancers or NSCLC when ALK mutations are present.\n\nIn a non-randomized, retrospective analysis from a phase 1 study, crizotinib was found to improve one to two-year survival rates for patients from 44-12% to 74-54%.\n\nCrizotinib has been shown to be a relatively non-toxic biomarker that has accomplished successful targeted therapy for people with a somatic mutation of the EGFR who have sensitivity to the ALK fusion oncogene although it remains an unmet medical need.\n\nThere have been reports of increased resistance to crizotinib which may require further research.", "role": "assistant"}], "category": "Summarize"}
{"prompt": "tldr, what are the bottom-line pros and cons of why I should invest vs pay off a house?\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n\n\nThe pros and cons of paying off a mortgage early depend on the borrower's financial circumstances, the loan's interest rate, and how close the individual is to retirement. Another consideration is whether to invest that money instead. Consider the interest cost that could be saved by paying off a mortgage ten years early compared to various investment returns earned by investing the money in the market.\n\nKEY TAKEAWAYS\nWhether paying off the mortgage early is a good choice can depend on your financial situation, the loan's interest rate, and how close you are to retirement.\nPaying off a mortgage has its benefits, but consider other factors such as the tax deductibility of mortgage interest and low loan rates.\nInvesting the money instead may generate higher returns than the loan's interest cost, but markets also come with the risk of losses.\nHow Paying Off a Home Affects Your Finances\nMortgage payments are made up of two components: interest on the loan and a principal amount that pays down the total outstanding balance. A $1,500 monthly payment might pay $500 toward interest. The other $1,000 will reduce the principal loan balance. Interest rates on a mortgage loan can vary depending on the economy and the borrower's creditworthiness.\n\nA loan payment schedule over a 30-year period is referred to as an amortization schedule. The payments for a fixed-rate mortgage loan mostly go toward interest in the early years. A larger portion of the loan payment is applied toward reducing the principal in later years.\n\nAssume that you have a 30-year mortgage with a starting balance of $200,000 and a fixed interest rate of 3.5%. It would work out like this.\n\nComponents of a Mortgage\n Payment Number\t Monthly Payment\tPrincipal\t Interest\t Loan Balance Remaining\n 1\t $898.09\t$314.76\t $583.33\t $199,685.24\n 109 (10 years)\t $898.09\t$431.10\t $499.99\t $159,679.65\n 229 (20 years)\t $898.09\t$611.45\t $286.64\t $97,665.59\n301 (25 years)\t$898.09\t$754.10\t$143.99\t$48,613.86\n360 (last payment)\t$898.09\t$895.48\t$2.61\t0.00\nSample Loan Payment Schedule with Interest and Principal\n\nA larger portion of the fixed monthly payment goes toward paying interest during the first ten years, but the percentage of the monthly payment that goes toward interest versus principal reverses as time goes on. More than $611 went toward principal while $286.64 went toward interest after 20 years. All but $2.61 of the last monthly payment went toward paying the principal balance.\n\nThe portion of the mortgage loan payment that's applied to principal and interest changes over the years because the loan balance is higher in the early years and smaller in the later years. You're paying interest on more of a balance in the early years. Less interest is owed as the monthly payments eventually reduce the outstanding loan.\n\nHow much interest will you save?\nSome homeowners choose to pay off their mortgages early, and the benefits can vary depending on your financial circumstances. Retirees might want to reduce or eliminate their mortgage debts because they're no longer earning employment income.\n\nLet's assume that a borrower has received an inheritance of $120,000. There are ten years left on their mortgage. The original mortgage was $200,000 at a fixed interest rate over 30 years. This table shows what it would cost to pay off the loan ten years early and how much interest would be saved based on three loan rates: 3.5%, 4.5%, or 5.5%.\n\nCost to Payoff Mortgage Ten Years Early and Interest Saved\n10 Year Balance Remaining\tInterest Rate \tTotal Interest Cost for 30 Years\tInterest Saved\n $97,665\t 3.5%\t$123,312\t$20,270\n $104,735\t 4.5%\t$164,813\t$28,411\n$111,657\t5.5%\t$208,808\t$37,618\nBalance Remaining in Ten Years at Various Interest Rates ($200K Starting Balance)\nThe higher the interest rate, the larger the amount remaining on the loan will be with ten years left on the mortgage.\n\nSave interest by paying off the loan\nThe total interest cost for the 30-year loan would be $123,312 at the 3.5% interest rate. The borrower would save $20,270 by paying it off ten years early.\n\nSaving more than $20,000 in interest is significant, but the interest amount saved represents only 17% of the total interest cost for a 30-year loan: $103,042 in interest has already been paid in the loan's first 20 years ($123,312 - $20,270), which accounts for 83% of the total interest over the life of the loan.\n\nHow Investing Affects Your Finances\nIt might be worth considering whether some or all of your money might be better off invested in the financial markets. The rate of return earned from investing might exceed the interest you'd pay on the mortgage over the final ten years of the loan.\n\nThe \"opportunity cost,\" the foregone interest that could be earned in the market, should be considered. But many factors go into evaluating an investment, including the expected return and the risk associated with the investment.

Interest was earned on the interest and no money was withdrawn during the ten-year period.\n\nInvestment Gains vs. Loan Interest Saved\nA homeowner would earn $22,019 based on an average rate of return of 2% if they invested $100,000 rather than use the money to pay down their mortgage in ten years. There would be no material difference between investing the money versus paying off the 3.5% mortgage based on the $20,270 saved in interest from the earlier loan table.\n\nBut the homeowner would earn $62,889 if the average rate of return was 5% for the ten years. This is more money than the interest saved in all three of the earlier loan scenarios whether the loan rate was 3.5% ($20,270), 4.5% ($28,411), or 5.5% ($37,618).\n\n The borrower would earn more than double the interest saved from paying the loan off early, even with using the 5.5% loan rate, with a ten-year rate of return of 7% or 10%.\nRepaying their mortgage rather than investing the money not only saves the borrower the interest they would have paid on the mortgage, but it also frees up money that otherwise would have gone to monthly repayments. This money could also be invested with the same rate of return.\n\nDifferent investments come with different risks\nEach type of investment comes with its own risk. U.S. Treasury bonds would be considered low-risk investments because they're guaranteed by the U.S. government if they're held until their expiration date or maturity.\n1\n But equities or stock investments have a higher risk of price fluctuations, called volatility, and this can lead to losses.\n\nThere's a risk that some or all your money could be lost if you decide to invest your money in the market instead of paying off your mortgage ten years early. You would still have to make ten years of loan payments as a result if the investment loses money.\n\nThe stock market can provide sizable returns, but there's also a risk of sizable losses. Just as taking on more risk can magnify investment gains, it can also lead to more losses so the market risk is a double-edged sword.\n\nA 10% investment gain isn't an easy goal to achieve, particularly after factoring in fees, taxes, and inflation.\n2\n Investors should have realistic expectations as to what they can earn in the market.", "prompt_id": "b2d68b337d2df5fa5bcccb8a9f36c067bcc1bc8045560b490c68bd1b6d234c9c", "messages": [{"content": "tldr, what are the bottom-line pros and cons of why I should invest vs pay off a house?\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n\n\nThe pros and cons of paying off a mortgage early depend on the borrower's financial circumstances, the loan's interest rate, and how close the individual is to retirement.

{"prompt": "This article about Marco Polo contains extraneous information that I don't want to sift through.  Write a summary that eliminates the extra information and focuses on the main events in his life.\n\nItalian Trader at the Court of Kublai Khan\nAt the height of the Mongol Empire, Marco Polo served Emperor Kublai Khan in China and returned to Venice to write an account of his experiences that would give Europeans some of their earliest information about China.\nBackground\nIn the 13th century, people who lived in Venice, Italy, believed that the Sun revolved around the Earth and that creation occurred exactly 4,484 years before Rome was founded. As Christians, they considered Jerusalem, the place of Jesus\u2019s crucifixion, to be the so-called navel of the world, and their maps portrayed this.\nMarco Polo was born in Venice, or possibly Croatia, in 1254. Located on the eastern coast of Italy, Venice served as a gateway to the riches of Asia during this era of increasing trade. Goods flowed like water through the city. Ships from around the eastern Mediterranean docked at its port. Merchants and traders set sail from Venice for Constantinople (now Istanbul) and the Black Sea to fetch goods from Russia and from merchants who traveled the Silk Roads, a system of trading routes to and from China that crossed the mountains and deserts of Central Asia.\nAt the time of Marco\u2019s birth, his father, Niccolo, and two uncles, all merchants, were away trading. Supposedly they were visiting cities on the Black Sea, but their adventures had actually taken them all the way to the Mongol capital of China, Khanbaliq (city of the Khan). There they had an audience with the most powerful ruler of the day, Kublai Khan, grandson of the founding emperor, Genghis Khan. When the three Polo men returned to Venice after an absence of 16 years, Niccolo found that his wife had died and that he had a 15-year-old son, Marco, whom he did not know existed.\nTravels\nTwo years later, in 1271, Niccolo Polo and his brother, Maffeo, set off again, taking the 17-year-old Marco with them. This time they aimed directly for the court of Kublai Khan, to bring him documents from the pope and holy oil from Jerusalem that he had requested. Even with a gold passport from Kublai Khan, which enabled the travelers to use lodgings and horses posted by the Mongols along the Silk Road routes, they took three and a half years to arrive. Upon reaching the summer palace of Kublai Khan in 1275, Niccolo presented his son and offered him in service to the emperor.\n\nA talented young man, Marco had learned several languages along the way, including Mongolian (though not Chinese), and had mastered four written alphabets. Two years before Marco\u2019s arrival, Kublai Khan had completed the conquest of all parts of China and needed non-Mongol administrators in areas that resisted having Mongol authorities. Marco took on various sorts of diplomatic and administrative roles for the emperor from his base in Dadu, which Kublai Khan built next to Khanbaliq. Both Dadu and Khanbaliq stood at what is now Beijing.\nAfter more than 16 years in China, the Polos begged permission from Kublai Khan to return home to Venice. Apparently they had proved so useful to the khan that he did not want them to leave. Finally, he agreed for them to escort a Mongolian princess, Cogatin, to become the bride of a Persian khan; thus they headed back west.\n\nThis time they traveled by sea in Chinese ships and, after many difficulties, succeeded in delivering the princess. Before they could reach Venice, however, Kublai Khan died on February 18, 1294, which allowed local rulers to reassert themselves and demand payment from traders. Consequently, the Polos were forced to hand over 4,000 Byzantine coins, a significant portion of their fortune, to the local government of a city on the Black Sea.\nReturn\nThe Polos returned to Venice in 1295, having been away 24 years. Their enthusiastic biographer told stories, which may have been gossip, that when they returned they were wearing Mongolian clothing and could hardly remember their native language. Their relatives had thought them long dead. But when they produced a small fortune in gems (rubies, sapphires, garnets, diamonds, and emeralds), which had been sewn into the hems of their Mongolian garments, they were warmly welcomed.\nSoon Venice was at war with its rival city-state, Genoa, on the west coast of Italy. As was custom for a wealthy merchant, Marco Polo financed his own war galley. He was captured during a naval battle and ended up in prison in Genoa.\nBy chance, one of his cellmates, Rusticello from Pisa, had experience writing romantic novels. As Polo entertained everyone with his tales of traveling to China, Rusticello wrote them down in a French dialect. This is how Polo\u2019s accounts, Europe\u2019s primary source of information about China until the 19th century, came into existence.\nIn 1299 Genoa and Venice declared peace; Polo was released and returned to Venice to marry Donata Badoer. The couple had three daughters in quick succession. He spent his remaining days as a businessman, working from home. He died there at almost 70 years of age, on January 8, 1324, and was buried under the church of San Lorenzo, though his tomb has now vanished.\n\n", "prompt_id": "a6cd5458f930b189508d7fcab859098e06da544ce9882e6df1d55cecf18cb07b", "messages": [{"content": "This article about Marco Polo contains extraneous information that I don't want to sift through.

Located on the eastern coast of Italy, Venice served as a gateway to the riches of Asia during this era of increasing trade. Goods flowed like water through the city. Ships from around the eastern Mediterranean docked at its port. Merchants and traders set sail from Venice for Constantinople (now Istanbul) and the Black Sea to fetch goods from Russia and from merchants who traveled the Silk Roads, a system of trading routes to and from China that crossed the mountains and deserts of Central Asia.\nAt the time of Marco\u2019s birth, his father, Niccolo, and two uncles, all merchants, were away trading. Supposedly they were visiting cities on the Black Sea, but their adventures had actually taken them all the way to the Mongol capital of China, Khanbaliq (city of the Khan). There they had an audience with the most powerful ruler of the day, Kublai Khan, grandson of the founding emperor, Genghis Khan. When the three Polo men returned to Venice after an absence of 16 years, Niccolo found that his wife had died and that he had a 15-year-old son, Marco, whom he did not know existed.\nTravels\nTwo years later, in 1271, Niccolo Polo and his brother, Maffeo, set off again, taking the 17-year-old Marco with them. This time they aimed directly for the court of Kublai Khan, to bring him documents from the pope and holy oil from Jerusalem that he had requested. Even with a gold passport from Kublai Khan, which enabled the travelers to use lodgings and horses posted by the Mongols along the Silk Road routes, they took three and a half years to arrive. Upon reaching the summer palace of Kublai Khan in 1275, Niccolo presented his son and offered him in service to the emperor.\n\nA talented young man, Marco had learned several languages along the way, including Mongolian (though not Chinese), and had mastered four written alphabets. Two years before Marco\u2019s arrival, Kublai Khan had completed the conquest of all parts of China and needed non-Mongol administrators in areas that resisted having Mongol authorities. Marco took on various sorts of diplomatic and administrative roles for the emperor from his base in Dadu, which Kublai Khan built next to Khanbaliq. Both Dadu and Khanbaliq stood at what is now Beijing.\nAfter more than 16 years in China, the Polos begged permission from Kublai Khan to return home to Venice. Apparently they had proved so useful to the khan that he did not want them to leave. Finally, he agreed for them to escort a Mongolian princess, Cogatin, to become the bride of a Persian khan; thus they headed back west.\n\nThis time they traveled by sea in Chinese ships and, after many difficulties, succeeded in delivering the princess. Before they could reach Venice, however, Kublai Khan died on February 18, 1294, which allowed local rulers to reassert themselves and demand payment from traders. Consequently, the Polos were forced to hand over 4,000 Byzantine coins, a significant portion of their fortune, to the local government of a city on the Black Sea.\nReturn\nThe Polos returned to Venice in 1295, having been away 24 years. Their enthusiastic biographer told stories, which may have been gossip, that when they returned they were wearing Mongolian clothing and could hardly remember their native language. Their relatives had thought them long dead. But when they produced a small fortune in gems (rubies, sapphires, garnets, diamonds, and emeralds), which had been sewn into the hems of their Mongolian garments, they were warmly welcomed.\nSoon Venice was at war with its rival city-state, Genoa, on the west coast of Italy. As was custom for a wealthy merchant, Marco Polo financed his own war galley. He was captured during a naval battle and ended up in prison in Genoa.\nBy chance, one of his cellmates, Rusticello from Pisa, had experience writing romantic novels. As Polo entertained everyone with his tales of traveling to China, Rusticello wrote them down in a French dialect. This is how Polo\u2019s accounts, Europe\u2019s primary source of information about China until the 19th century, came into existence.\nIn 1299 Genoa and Venice declared peace; Polo was released and returned to Venice to marry Donata Badoer. The couple had three daughters in quick succession. He spent his remaining days as a businessman, working from home. He died there at almost 70 years of age, on January 8, 1324, and was buried under the church of San Lorenzo, though his tomb has now vanished.\n\n", "role": "user"}, {"content": "Marco Polo, who lived in Venice, a major trading center was born into a family of trading merchants in 1254. His father, who had been seeking trade in the East, did not know Marco until he was 15. In 1271, his father left once more, taking Marco along to visit the court of Kublai Khan. They reached their destination in 1275.\n\nBecause Marco spoke many languages, including Mongolian, and Kublai Khan needed Mongolian-speaking administrators for the newly conquered region, Marco served Khan in administrative and diplomatic roles. Appointed to escort a princess to Persia, the Polos returned to Venice after more than 24 years away bringing along a small fortune.\n\nMarco Polo, who took part in a war between Venice and Genoa was captured and ended up in prison where he met Rusticello who wrote novels.

His principal fame and influence, however, rests on his \"system\" of actor training, preparation, and rehearsal technique.\n\nStanislavski (his stage name) performed and directed as an amateur until the age of 33, when he co-founded the world-famous Moscow Art Theatre (MAT) company with Vladimir Nemirovich-Danchenko, following a legendary 18-hour discussion. Its influential tours of Europe (1906) and the US (1923\u201324), and its landmark productions of The Seagull (1898) and Hamlet (1911\u201312), established his reputation and opened new possibilities for the art of the theatre. By means of the MAT, Stanislavski was instrumental in promoting the new Russian drama of his day\u2014principally the work of Anton Chekhov, Maxim Gorky, and Mikhail Bulgakov\u2014to audiences in Moscow and around the world; he also staged acclaimed productions of a wide range of classical Russian and European plays.\n\nHe collaborated with the director and designer Edward Gordon Craig and was formative in the development of several other major practitioners, including Vsevolod Meyerhold (whom Stanislavski considered his \"sole heir in the theatre\"), Yevgeny Vakhtangov, and Michael Chekhov. At the MAT's 30-year anniversary celebrations in 1928, a massive heart attack on-stage put an end to his acting career (though he waited until the curtain fell before seeking medical assistance). He continued to direct, teach, and write about acting until his death a few weeks before the publication of the first volume of his life's great work, the acting manual An Actor's Work (1938). He was awarded the Order of the Red Banner of Labour and the Order of Lenin and was the first to be granted the title of People's Artist of the USSR.\n\nStanislavski wrote that \"there is nothing more tedious than an actor's biography\" and that \"actors should be banned from talking about themselves\".

Inside, a courtyard hosts the miniature temperate rainforest which rises two stories to the glass canopy above.

Sadly, after the fall of the Roman Empire, organized ice transport from mountains to the cities below stopped, and ice cream continued to be even more expensive product.

{"prompt": "Summarize the following text about the 2016 World Series in no more than 8 sentences. Keep the sentences short (< 25 words per sentence).\n\nThe 2016 World Series was the 112th edition of Major League Baseball's World Series, a best-of-seven playoff between the National League (NL) champion Chicago Cubs and the American League (AL) champion Cleveland Indians, the first meeting of those franchises in postseason history.\n\nCorey Kluber made World Series history by striking out eight hitters in the first three innings of Game 1. In the first, the Indians loaded the bases off Jon Lester on a single and two walks before Jose Ramirez's single drove in a run, then Lester hit Brandon Guyer with a pitch to force in another. Perez's home run in the fifth made it 3-0 Indians. In the eighth, Justin Grimm walked Guyer with two outs and allowed a single to Lonnie Chisenhall, then Hector Rondon allowed Perez's second home run of the night. Andrew Miller and Cody Allen finished the victory for the Indians despite Miller having to pitch out of a bases-loaded jam in the seventh, and the Indians took Game 1 of the series 6-0.\n\nLooking to tie the series at one game apiece, the Cubs sent Jake Arrieta to the mound against the Indians' Trevor Bauer. The Cubs also featured six players under age 25 in the starting lineup, a postseason record. The Cubs started things off early as Kris Bryant singled in the first inning and Anthony Rizzo doubled to score Bryant and give the Cubs an early 1-0 lead. The Cubs struck again in the third following a two-out walk by Rizzo and a single by Ben Zobrist. A single by Kyle Schwarber scored Rizzo from second and pushed the Cubs' lead to 2-0. Bauer was forced from the game in the fourth, and the Cubs struck again in the fifth. Rizzo walked again off Zach McAllister, and Zobrist tripled to plate Rizzo. Another run-scoring single by Schwarber off Bryan Shaw and a bases-loaded walk by Addison Russell pushed the lead to 5-0. Arrieta continued to pitch well, walking three batters but holding the Indians without a hit into the sixth inning. In the sixth, a double by Jason Kipnis ended the no-hitter, moved to third on a groundout and scored the lone Indians run of the game on a wild pitch by Arrieta. Arrieta allowed another single and was lifted for reliever Mike Montgomery. Both teams threatened in the seventh but could not score and, following a single by Mike Napoli in the bottom of the eighth, Aroldis Chapman entered to finish the game for the Cubs. The win marked the Cubs' first World Series game victory since 1945, and tied up the series at one game all.\n\nChicago pitcher Kyle Hendricks started against Cleveland pitcher Josh Tomlin during Game 3, a low-scoring contest where the only run came off a Coco Crisp single that scored Michael Martinez from third in the seventh inning. Tomlin, Andrew Miller, Bryan Shaw, and Cody Allen combined to shut out the Cubs. Allen earned his sixth postseason save as Javier Baez struck out swinging to end the game, leaving the tying and winning runs in scoring position.\n\nThe Cubs struck first in Game 4 when Dexter Fowler doubled to lead off the first and scored on Anthony Rizzo's one-out single, but Kluber held them to that one run through six innings before Francona turned it over to the bullpen. In the second, Carlos Santana's leadoff home run off Lackey tied the game; then, with two on, Kluber's RBI single put the Indians up 2-1. Next inning, Jason Kipnis hit a leadoff double and scored on Francisco Lindor's single. In the sixth, Lonnie Chisenhall's sacrifice fly with two on off Mike Montgomery made it 4-1 Indians. Next inning, Justin Grimm allowed a leadoff double and one-out hit-by-pitch before being relieved by Travis Wood, who gave up a three-run home run to Kipnis put to the Indians ahead 7-1. The Cubs got one run back in the eighth, but the Indians were now just one win away from a World Series championship.\n\nJose Ramirez hit a home run for Cleveland in the second inning of Game 5, but the Cubs, facing elimination, scored three runs in the fourth inning off Trevor Bauer. Kris Bryant led off the inning with a home run. Anthony Rizzo then doubled and Ben Zobrist singled. Addison Russell's RBI single put the Cubs up 2-1. After Jason Heyward struck out, Javier Baez's bunt single moved Zobrist to third before David Ross's sacrifice fly made it 3-1 Cubs. The Indians cut their deficit to 3-2 off Lester in the sixth on Francisco Lindor's RBI single that scored Rajai Davis from second base. With the tying run on second base in the seventh inning, Maddon brought in Aroldis Chapman, who threw 2.2 scoreless innings, earning his first save of the 2016 World Series.\n\nHow do you force a Game 7? Score three runs in the first inning, all with two outs, then hit a grand slam in the fourth inning. The Indians nipped away in the fourth, fifth, and ninth inning, but starting with a 7-run lead meant this Fall Classic was going to come down to a single deciding game, a true Fall Classic.\n\nGame 7 of the 2016 World Series would go down as a classic, some calling it the greatest Game 7 in World Series history. The pitching matchup featured Kyle Hendricks, who had started Game 3 for the Cubs, and Corey Kluber, who had won games 1 and 4 and was pitching on three days' rest.\n\nDexter Fowler led off the game with a home run for Chicago off Kluber, becoming the first player ever to hit a lead-off home run in a World Series Game 7! The Indians tied the game in the bottom of the third inning with an RBI single by Carlos Santana, but the Cubs scored two runs in the fourth inning with a sacrifice fly by Addison Russell (Kris Bryant running aggressively to tag up from third on the short fly ball and slide under the tag at home) and a double by Willson Contreras. To start the fifth inning, Javier Baez hit a home run to center on the first pitch he saw to knock Kluber out of the game. Andrew Miller came on in relief and gave up a walk to Bryant and RBI single to Anthony Rizzo to push the lead to 5-1 (Bryant's aggressiveness again instrumental as he was attempting to steal second on the hit, allowing him to score all the way from first).\n\nIn the bottom of the fifth inning, Hendricks retired the first two batters. A two-out walk to Santana persuaded Joe Maddon to relieve his starter. This move, along with others throughout the series, would be highly criticized afterward, as it appeared to some that Hendricks was pulled out too soon.\n\nJon Lester, who had started Games 1 and 5, came on in relief for the first time since the 2007 ALCS, coincidentally also against the Indians. David Ross committed a throwing error that allowed Jason Kipnis to reach base and put runners on second and third. A wild pitch that ricocheted off Ross's helmet allowed Santana and Kipnis to score, narrowing the Cubs' lead to 5-3. To atone for his blunders, the 39-year-old Ross hit a home run to center, in his final at-bat of his career, in the top of the sixth to make it a 6-3 game, becoming the oldest player to hit a home run in a World Series Game 7.\n\nLester retired the first two batters in the eighth inning, but was pulled after a Jose Ramirez single. Maddon opted to use Aroldis Chapman, who had thrown 42 pitches in Game 5 and was used in Game 6 despite the fact that the Cubs had already built a large lead. Brandon Guyer promptly hit a run-scoring double off Chapman, making the score 6-4. The next batter was Indians center fielder Rajai Davis, who unexpectedly hit a dramatic home run off Chapman, just barely clearing the left field wall and the left field foul pole, scoring Guyer.\n\nWith the game tied 6-6 after nine innings, a sudden cloudburst resulted in a 17-minute rain delay. During the delay, Cub right fielder Jason Heyward called his teammates into a weight room behind Chicago's dugout and told them, \"We're the best team in baseball. Stick together and we're going to win this game.\"\n\nWhen play resumed in the top of the tenth, Kyle Schwarber led off with a single off Bryan Shaw to right and was replaced by pinch runner Albert Almora. Kris Bryant then hit a deep fly ball to center, and Almora tagged up to second base, in what was called the \"savviest baserunning play of the season.\" After an intentional walk to Anthony Rizzo, Ben Zobrist stepped up to the plate. Zobrist delivered a clutch RBI double into the left field corner, scoring Almora, and breaking the tie. After another intentional walk to Addison Russell, Miguel Montero singled into left, scoring Rizzo and making the score 8=6.\n\nCarl Edwards was called on to finish off the Indians in the bottom of the tenth, but after retiring the first two hitters, he walked Brandon Guyer, who took second base on defensive indifference. Davis, following up on his eighth-inning heroics, lined a single to center, making it a one-run game. Maddon called on Mike Montgomery, who had zero career saves. Montgomery retired Michael Martinez with an infield grounder fielded by Bryant, who threw to Rizzo to end the game, series, and the Cubs' 108-year world title drought.\n\nThe Cubs, playing in their eleventh World Series and their first since 1945, won their third championship and first since 1908, ending the longest world championship drought in North American professional sports history.", "prompt_id": "01314bfec4e46f9e01c7f0ea3b0f4ab9d54e3098d56d64846fbfbeba84357e46", "messages": [{"content": "Summarize the following text about the 2016 World Series in no more than 8 sentences.

Located in the open savanna of South Africa\u2019s North West Province, the private land is indicated only by wired fencing along the road. A turn onto a path leading up to Hume\u2019s house reveals a hulking gray mass, just as the blood\u00ad-red sun starts to descend across miles of roaming ground. It\u2019s a bull rhinoceros, but he doesn\u2019t look like anything you might find in a wildlife photo book. In place of the magnificent scimitar, the rhino bears a stunted, blunt block of gray nail atop its nose. It\u2019s been cut to save his life and, perhaps, one day, make Hume incredibly rich.\nA sturdy man with wire\u00ad-frame glasses and graying hair, Hume may be the largest private rhino rancher in the world\u2014with a herd of over 900 and growing. He wakes up before dawn and drives out to sections of his land to check on certain rhinos. He helps his hired hands throw hay and pellets\u2014dietary supplements\u2014into large pits where the rhinos feed. And, when the time comes, he supervises a veterinarian and his workers as they dehorn the animals.\n\nHume has bred and kept rhinos for the past twenty-\u00adthree years, adding to the less than 25,000 black and white rhinos currently in South Africa. His goal is to breed an additional 200 over the next year. While South Africa is home to almost 75 percent of the rhinos in the continent, it also has a far higher rate of horn poaching than neighboring Botswana, where populations linger in the hundreds, or Namibia, where they linger below 2,300. Since a 2009 trade ban on rhino horn was imposed in South Africa, Hume has stockpiled all of the horns he routinely cuts from his herd. He keeps them in hopes of a potential future payoff, when the South African government lifts the ban, if it ever does. But the dehorning also helps ensure the animals\u2019 safety. It\u2019s a measure designed to make the rhinos less attractive to poachers, who are becoming more brazen in their attempts, straying from the relative isolation of large preserves to kill domesticated rhinos on private property.", "prompt_id": "d072c2b7c52121aed47f9911b852f8d4aad8e5bd0f3ad6d0e29df8fee32fbc2f", "messages": [{"content": "Give me a brief overview of what this article is about.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to get lost on the dirt roads to John Hume\u2019s place.

And, when the time comes, he supervises a veterinarian and his workers as they dehorn the animals.\n\nHume has bred and kept rhinos for the past twenty-\u00adthree years, adding to the less than 25,000 black and white rhinos currently in South Africa. His goal is to breed an additional 200 over the next year. While South Africa is home to almost 75 percent of the rhinos in the continent, it also has a far higher rate of horn poaching than neighboring Botswana, where populations linger in the hundreds, or Namibia, where they linger below 2,300. Since a 2009 trade ban on rhino horn was imposed in South Africa, Hume has stockpiled all of the horns he routinely cuts from his herd. He keeps them in hopes of a potential future payoff, when the South African government lifts the ban, if it ever does. But the dehorning also helps ensure the animals\u2019 safety. It\u2019s a measure designed to make the rhinos less attractive to poachers, who are becoming more brazen in their attempts, straying from the relative isolation of large preserves to kill domesticated rhinos on private property.", "role": "user"}, {"content": "John Hume is the largest private rhino rancher in the world.

{"prompt": "Summarize what this article says about depression for a layman.\n\nMajor depression is one of the most prevalent and debilitating psychiatric afflictions. It is characterized by pervasive and recurrent episodes of low mood and motivation, despair and anhedonia. Despite the availability of several classes of antidepressants, more than a third of patients are either unremitting or relapsing (Bambico and Gobbi, 2008, Zisook et al., 2008). Antidepressants that are known to act on the brain's monoamine systems are limited by a delayed onset of therapeutic action. Moreover, the pathophysiology of depression is far from being fully elucidated. Multiple levels of dysfunction have been proposed, including impaired synaptic transmission of the monoamine 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT or serotonin) (Bambico et al., 2009a), which is produced by the midbrain raphe 5-HT neurons (Dahlstr\u00f6m and Fuxe, 1964, Descarries et al., 1982), and known to regulate emotional, vegetative and neuroendocrine functions (Holmes, 2008). Not surprisingly, drugs that augment 5-HT transmission, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), are most preferred first-line treatments (Vaswani et al., 2003). Their chronic application facilitates exocytosis of 5-HT and/or increases 5-HT synaptic availability in corticolimbic regions extensively innervated by the raphe. Many of these forebrain structures, including the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus and amygdala are implicated in mood regulation and stress adaptation (Holmes, 2008). On the other hand, chronic stress that is known to be a risk factor for depression impairs presynaptic and postsynaptic 5-HT transmission (Bambico et al., 2009b). Also, acute or repeated 5-HT or tryptophan depletion precipitates anxiety/depression-like behaviors in animals (Blokland et al., 2002) and mood-lowering effects in humans (for review, Young and Leyton, 2002), exacerbates anxiogenic responses in human subjects (Miller et al., 2000), and triggers relapse in depressive patients (for review, Van der Does, 2001).", "prompt_id": "1edf4b30e1d706b95a6041c8f0156b0b9e41bc156430ab9e6b1b94e04f8482a1", "messages": [{"content": "Summarize what this article says about depression for a layman.\n\nMajor depression is one of the most prevalent and debilitating psychiatric afflictions.

Lyme disease is the most common tick-borne infection in the U.S., mostly in the Northeast and Midwest. An estimated 476,000 Americans are diagnosed with Lyme disease each year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Black-legged ticks, also called deer ticks, can carry more than Lyme-causing bacteria. They can also spread babesiosis, anaplasmosis and Powassan virus disease.

Ticks pick up disease-causing germs by biting infected wildlife, usually rodents.\n\nWHEN IS TICK SEASON?\n\nIt varies by region, but tick season generally stretches from April to October. Ticks are mostly dormant during the cold winter months, and emerge as temperatures rise, but can be active on warm winter days, too.

Focus on the highlights of her career rather than her personal life and use less than 100 words.\n\nBorn\nFebruary 27, 1847 \u00b7 Coventry, Warwickshire, England, UK\nDied\nJuly 21, 1928 \u00b7 Small Hythe, Kent, England, UK (stroke)\nBirth name\nEllen Alice Terry\nMini Bio\nLegendary British stage actress who made a few silent film appearances. The daughter of strolling players, she was born in Coventry into an almost exclusively theatrical family. Her grandparents were actors, as were all six of her siblings. But only her son, Edward Gordon Craig, would in any way approach her fame in the theatre, albeit as a designer rather than as an actor. She made her debut in 1856 at the age of 8 before an audience which included Queen Victoria. By age 11, she had played a dozen roles including Puck. At 16, after showing early brilliance, she played \"An American Cousin\" (a year before the famed American production clouded by Lincoln's assassination) and then retired. After six years, still only 22, she returned to the stage and in 1875 played a landmark Portia in \"The Merchant of Venice.\" For the next three decades, she played every major Shakespearean role opposite the greatest British tragedians, in England and in America. Her long association with theatrical giant Henry Irving ended with his death, but a year later, in 1906, she began a long professional and personal relationship with George Bernard Shaw. After more than half a century onstage, she undertook a tour of England, America, and Australia, lecturing on the theatre and on Shakespeare. She was coaxed into a film appearance in 1916 and played in a handful of additional pictures through 1922.

The daughter of strolling players, she was born in Coventry into an almost exclusively theatrical family. Her grandparents were actors, as were all six of her siblings. But only her son, Edward Gordon Craig, would in any way approach her fame in the theatre, albeit as a designer rather than as an actor. She made her debut in 1856 at the age of 8 before an audience which included Queen Victoria. By age 11, she had played a dozen roles including Puck. At 16, after showing early brilliance, she played \"An American Cousin\" (a year before the famed American production clouded by Lincoln's assassination) and then retired. After six years, still only 22, she returned to the stage and in 1875 played a landmark Portia in \"The Merchant of Venice.\" For the next three decades, she played every major Shakespearean role opposite the greatest British tragedians, in England and in America. Her long association with theatrical giant Henry Irving ended with his death, but a year later, in 1906, she began a long professional and personal relationship with George Bernard Shaw. After more than half a century onstage, she undertook a tour of England, America, and Australia, lecturing on the theatre and on Shakespeare. She was coaxed into a film appearance in 1916 and played in a handful of additional pictures through 1922.
